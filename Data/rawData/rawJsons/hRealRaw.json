        "text": "Rex Tillerson, the businessman nominated by Donald Trump to be the next US secretary of state, was the long time director of a US Russian oil firm based in the tax haven of the Bahamas, leaked documents show. Tillerson the chief executive of ExxonMobil became a director of the oil company s Russian subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas, in . His name RW Tillerson appears next to other officers who are based at Houston, Texas Moscow and Sakhalin, in Russia s far east. Who is Donald Trump s secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson? The leaked document comes from the corporate registry in the Bahamas. It was one of . m files given to the Germany newspaper S ddeutsche Zeitung by an anonymous source. The registry is public but details of individual directors are typically incomplete or missing entirely. Though there is nothing untoward about this directorship, it has not been reported before and is likely to raise fresh questions over Tillerson s relationship with Russia ahead of a potentially stormy confirmation hearing by the US senate foreign relations committee. Exxon said on Sunday that Tillerson was no longer a director after becoming the company s CEO in . ExxonMobil s use of offshore regimes while legal may also jar with Trump s avowal to put America first . Tillerson s critics say he is too close to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and that his appointment could raise potential conflicts of interest. ExxonMobil is the world s largest oil company and has for a long time been eyeing Russia s vast oil and gas deposits. Tillerson currently has Exxon stock worth more than m. Since his nomination, Tillerson s Russia ties have become a source of bipartisan concern. In , Putin awarded him the Russian Order of Friendship. Tillerson is close to Igor Sechin, the head of Russian state oil company Rosneft and the de facto second most powerful figure inside the Kremlin. A hardliner, Sechin is ex KGB. Tillerson s award followed a deal between ExxonMobil and Rosneft to explore the Kara Sea, in Russia s Arctic. It was put on hold in after the Obama administration imposed wide ranging sanctions against Russia. The sanctions were punishment for Putin s Crimea annexation that spring and Russia s undercover invasion of eastern Ukraine. The ban covers the US sharing of sophisticated offshore and shale oil technology. Exxon was supposed to halt its drilling with Rosneft. The firm successfully pleaded with the US Treasury department to delay the ban by a few weeks, with the Kremlin threatening to seize its rig. In this brief window Exxon discovered a major Arctic field with some m barrels of new oil. Tillerson has criticised the US government s policy on Russia. In he told Exxon s annual meeting that we do not support sanctions . He added We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who they are really harming. It is widely assumed by investors that the new Trump administration will drop sanctions. This would allow the Kara joint venture to resume, boosting Exxon s share price and yielding potential profits in the tens of billions of dollars. According to company records, Tillerson currently owns m of stock. His Exxon pension is worth about m. Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson shaking hands Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vladimir Putin awarded Rex Tillerson the Russian Order of Friendship. Photograph Alexei Nikolsky Tass The Senate foreign relations committee is currently split to between Republicans and Democrats. But several heavyweight Republicans, including John McCain, have raised doubts about Tillerson s nomination and his lack of experience to be America s top diplomat after four decades spent exclusively in the oil industry. Republican senator Marco Rubio who sits on the committee said on Tuesday that he had serious concerns about giving Tillerson the job. Rubio praised him as a respected businessman but said that the next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity and who has a clear sense of America s interests . Tillerson is likely to get rid of his Exxon stock if the narrowly Republican majority Senate confirms his appointment. Controversy over his links with Russia comes at a time when the topic is politically red hot, after the CIA said earlier this month that Kremlin hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats in order to help Trump. The president elect has dismissed the CIA s assessment, calling it ridiculous . The Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, says Putin targeted her for reasons of personal revenge. As well as on oil and gas, the Obama administration has imposed personal sanctions on Putin s friends, including Sechin. Sechin has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson . Currently, Sechin is forbidden from entering the country. This new revelation about Tillerson s directorship sheds light on the use by multinational companies of contrived offshore structures, now under scrutiny following April s massive Panama Papers leak. Exxon Neftegas s most important oil and gas project is Sakhalin . It is located in the sub Arctic, off the frozen and difficult to access north east coast of Russia s Sakhalin island. This is , km , miles away from the subsidiary s official business home in Nassau, the semi tropical capital of the Bahamas. The Bahamas is notorious for secrecy and has a corporate tax rate of zero. The documents from the Bahamas corporate registry were shared by S ddeutsche Zeitung with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC. They show that Exxon registered at least companies in the secretive tax haven, covering operations in countries from Russia to Venezuela to Azerbaijan. Robert Gates criticises laid back US response to Russia election hack Read more Exxon Neftegas features in about leaked offshore documents. The oil firm was incorporated in by a law firm in Nassau, Higgs Johnson. Another veteran law firm, Lobosky Management Ltd, subsequently took over as registered agent. The company secretary, Sophia Kishinevsky, signed the paperwork and made annual filings. Exxon said it had no comment on whether Tillerson should now divest his Exxon holdings and resign from his positions with all Exxon entities. It said the oil firm had incorporated some of its affiliates in the Bahamas because of simplicity and predictability . It is not done to reduce tax in the country where the company operates, Exxon said. Incorporation of a company in the Bahamas does not decrease ExxonMobil s tax liability in the country where the entity generates its income. The firm was one of the largest taxpayers in the world, with an effective global tax rate in of , it said. Its effective tax rate over the past three years , , was , it added. This compared favourably with other Fortune companies, which have substantially lower effective tax rates than ExxonMobil .",

        "text": "President elect Donald Trump has nominated Mick Mulvaney, a conservative Republican congressman from South Carolina who is known as a budget hawk , as director of the Office of Management and Budget. In a statement issued on Saturday morning shortly after Trump tweeted an inflammatory comment about China s seizure of a US navy drone in the South China Sea Trump called Mulvaney a very high energy leader with deep convictions for how to responsibly manage our nation s finances and save our country from drowning in red ink . Trump also said that with Mulvaney as his budget director, his administration would make smart choices and renew the American taxpayer s trust in how their money is spent . Mulvaney said he would help restore budgetary and fiscal sanity after eight years of an out of control, tax and spend financial agenda under Barack Obama. Like other Trump nominations, the budget director s job requires Senate approval. Mulvaney s nomination follows a pattern of Trump turning to individuals with records apparently hostile to the agencies they are nominated to lead. For example, the Oklahoma attorney general, Scott Pruitt, a leading critic of climate change theories, has been nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. In other such moves, the billionaire and charter schools advocate Betsy DeVos has been nominated as education secretary and the Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, a critic of voting rights legislation, has been nominated as attorney general. The announcement about Mulvaney was made as Trump, who takes office on January, began his holiday vacation at Mar a Lago, his oceanfront club in Palm Beach, Florida. Mulvaney, , was an outspoken critic of the former House speaker John Boehner, who resigned in amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. His selection points to a strategy by Trump to cut government where he can. The president elect has recently railed against what he has called a far too expensive new version of the Air Force One aircraft he will use, which Boeing is supposed to build. With Mick at the head of OMB, Trump said in his statement, my administration is going to make smart choices about America s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer s trust in how their money is spent. Mulvaney said Each day, families across our nation make disciplined choices about how to spend their hard earned money, and the federal government should exercise the same discretion that hard working Americans do every day, he said. On Friday night, Trump vowed to seek approval from Congress for tn in new spending to rebuild the country s crumbling network of roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure as a way to create jobs and make some needed repairs. We are going to fix our country. It s time. We have no choice. It s time, Trump said at a rally in Orlando, Florida.",

        "text": "Donald Trump appears to have not a clue how to lead a superpower. That was the conclusion of China s Global Times newspaper on Monday morning as the country s media weighed in on the president elect s latest social media assaults on Beijing. Don t let China ties slide into full conflict mode , Obama urges Trump Read more Trump is not behaving as a president who will become master of the White House in a month, the Communist party controlled newspaper wrote in an editorial. He bears no sense of how to lead a superpower. The article came after the US president elect again used Twitter, which has been blocked in China since , to berate the leaders of the world s second largest economy. China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented sic act, Trump tweeted early on Saturday morning after it emerged the Chinese navy had seized a US naval drone that had been operating in the South China Sea. In a second tweet, Trump wrote Those characters threatened to further alienate China s rulers, already reeling from Trump s recent decision to hold a minute phone call with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing wen, and threat to upend long standing US policy on Taiwan. On Friday, President Obama cautioned Trump against allowing relations with China slip into full conflict mode . In its editorial, the fervently nationalist Global Times, a state run tabloid that sometimes reflects official thinking, indicated such a deterioration was certainly on the cards if Trump continued to act up. People in China were unsure whether the billionaire s attacks on Beijing were part of attempts to wage a psychological war or simply an example of his amateurishness. But if he treats China after assuming office in the same way as in his tweets, China will not exercise restraint, the newspaper warned. The Chinese government should be fully prepared for a hardline Trump. In an online video that has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, the newspaper s controversial editor, Hu Xijin, said I don t know if he is playing the psychological card with China or is in fact just unprofessional China should teach him some lessons so he might learn to respect China after he is sworn in. A comment piece on the front page of the overseas edition of the Communist party s official mouthpiece, the People s Daily, also suggested Beijing would not be cowed by Trump s provocations. It is difficult to understand his true psychology, wrote Hua Yiwen, whom the paper described as an international affairs expert. But China shouldn t spend much effort trying to guess what he is thinking. We should simply stand firm, take control of the situation and handle it calmly. Bill Bishop, a Washington DC based China expert, said he sensed abject despair in the US capital at how Trump was conducting US China relations through misspelled tweets. This is unpresidented behaviour by a precedent elect, joked Bishop. It would be funny if the stakes weren t so high. China should plan to take Taiwan by force after Trump call, state media says Read more This is not a business deal. This is a political relationship between nuclear powers who are already on the path towards conflict in several dimensions, added Bishop, who publishes the influential Sinocism newsletter. This kind of uncertainty, this kind of petulance, this kind of random tweeting is not a grand strategy that is going to push the Chinese on to their heels so they are going to make concessions. This is juvenile, immature, inexperienced behaviour that has the potential to lead to many problems in the US China relationship, some of which could have some pretty serious and damaging ramifications. Bishop questioned the Chinese media s suggestion that Trump s tweets were part of a wily psychological ploy to force trade concessions from Beijing. I wouldn t ascribe brilliant psychological warfare skills to Donald Trump, he said. Was it possible Trump s tweets were part of an ingenious new master plan for Sino US relations that would emerge after his inauguration on January? Bishop was skeptical. I think that is about as likely as Xi Jinping waking up on December, and declaring China a democracy. ",

        "text": "In his latest Twitter tirade, President elect Donald Trump has once again claimed he could have won more votes than his rival Hillary Clinton. I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote but would campaign differently, he said. The Republican insisted his strategy was more sophisticated . He won nearly three million fewer votes than the Democratic candidate, but prevailed in the electoral college. The arcane but all important institution formally certified him earlier this week as winner of the presidential election. But the Manhattan billionaire is apparently still chafing at critics claims that he lacks a popular mandate. What exactly is the electoral college? In two other tweets on Wednesday morning, Mr Trump said Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!

        "text": "As Donald Trump s January inauguration draws closer, the president elect s administration is starting to take shape. What does it tell us about what we can expect from the Trump presidency? Although the incoming president has to fill more than , executive branch jobs scattered across dozens of agencies, departments and bureaus, there are top level Cabinet positions that require Senate confirmation. So far the Trump transition team has announced nominees for of the spots a th, interior secretary, is reportedly going to Ryan Zinke of Montana . First, the basics. Of those , are white men. For the first time since , none of the top four departments state, defence, treasury or justice will be headed by a woman or a member of an ethnic minority group. Ben Carson, tapped for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is the only African American. Elaine Chao transportation and Nikki Haley UN ambassador are the only Asians. Six have previously held elective office, and one Ms Chao has prior experience running a federal agency. That marks a significant change from past presidential administrations, which were well stocked with more experienced political hands. Mr Trump s Cabinet is a mix of rich businessmen, former military leaders and conservative true believers. He may have campaigned as an anti establishment outsider, but he s mostly surrounding himself with powerful, wealthy, influential men. While many may be outsiders to the game of elective politics, they re not exactly drawn from the ranks of the angry populist masses. Here s a closer look at how it all shakes out. You can follow Anthony on Twitter awzurcher Captains of industry ExxonMobil head Rex Tillerson sits at a shareholder meeting in Dallas.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Rex Tillerson hopes to move from the ExxonMobil boardroom to White House Cabinet meetings American voters elected a businessman with no political experience as their president, and he s filled many of his top administration jobs with businessmen who have no political experience. Leading the way are Rex Tillerson, who has helmed the international energy conglomerate ExxonMobil since , as secretary of state, and venture capitalist and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury. Other notable picks include the so called king of bankruptcy , Wilbur Ross, for commerce and fast food mogul Andrew Puzder at Labor. What we ve learned Mr Trump campaigned against a global elite that he said was stripping the working class of its wealth. By looking to Wall Street insiders and corporate chieftains for key administration spots, however, his post election actions signal a decidedly different mentality. Read more about Rex Tillerson wildcard diplomat Steven Mnuchin Secretary of the Treasury nominee Andrew Puzder Secretary of Labor Here come the generals At one point during the campaign, Mr Trump quipped that he knew more about fighting the so called Islamic State than many of the generals currently running US military operations. When it came time to fill out his national security apparatus, however, the president elect has frequently turned to the military brass. General James Mattis testifies before CongressImage copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption James Mattis is a former general that Donald Trump likes James Mattis defence and John Kelly homeland security are both retired generals, as is Michael Flynn, who Mr Trump has slated for national security adviser a position that does not require Senate confirmation . Taken individually, the picks are unremarkable ex military leaders sometimes wind up in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans. Colin Powell was George W Bush s secretary of state, and David Petraeus ran the Central Intelligence Agency under Barack Obama. Together, however, Mr Trump s picks give his administration a decidedly martial bent. While he may have mocked Mr Obama s generals, Mr Trump, who attended military school as a youth, seems inclined to favour the spit and polish of military leadership. The military is one of the few institutions still viewed favourably by the American public, and Mr Trump seems more than happy to march along with it. What we ve learned Candidate Trump often espoused a less interventionist foreign policy on the campaign trail, but President elect Trump s decision to surround himself with generals could indicate he will be quicker on the trigger. Read more about James Mattis Secretary of Defense nominee John Kelly Secretary of Homeland Security nominee Michael Flynn National Security Advisor The vanquished Former presidential candidate Rick Perry once called Mr Trump a cancer on the Republican Party. Ben Carson, another primary opponent, questioned the business mogul s religious faith. Now Mr Trump has chosen both to head Cabinet departments in his administration. Donald Trump and Ben Carson slap hands at a presidential debate.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Donald Trump has named Ben Carson to his presidential team There s a certain amount of irony in Mr Perry s selection, given that he is slotted to head the Department of Energy, which he famously forgot the name of when listing Cabinet level posts he d cut during a Republican primary debate. Although Mr Trump has only named two former adversaries to his administration, he s also rumoured to be considering former computer executive Carly Fiorina for an intelligence agency post. Then there s New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who was reportedly offered several Cabinet level positions after being passed over for attorney general. He s a foe turned friend who now, it seems, has been forgotten. What we ve learned Facing off against Mr Trump in the past isn t necessarily a deal breaker for the president elect, but a subsequent bent knee offered both by Mr Carson and Mr Perry is a key to bygones being bygones. Read more about Rick Perry Secretary of Energy nominee Ben Carson Secretary of Housing and Urban Development nominee Congressman Tom Price presides over a House Budget Committee hearing.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Tom Price, chair of the House Budget Committee, is a Washington power player The insiders According to a recent story in Politico, Mr Trump s transition team has been beset by conflicts between establishment party players, led by incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, and the conservative outsiders who helped run the Trump campaign. In a number of Cabinet positions, it appears the establishment landed the people they wanted. Tom Price, slated for Health and Human Services, is a member of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. Betsy DeVos, heading to education, is a long time conservative activist and Republican Party donor. Elaine Chao served as labour secretary under President George W Bush and is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, considered a party rising star, is the nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations. Given that Mr Trump is likely to be a hands off president when it comes to the day to day management of his administration, department heads will wield considerable power over the next four years. While the president elect has said there are portions of Barack Obama s healthcare reform that he likes, for instance, chances are Mr Price will use his health secretary authority to strip the programme of much of its power. While he may sit down with former Vice President Al Gore to talk climate change, his Environmental Protection Agency nominee, Scott Pruitt, is an outspoken critic and legal opponent of the agency he will head. What we ve learned Mr Trump railed against the political establishment on the campaign trail, but some of his nominees are very comfortable in the Washington swamp . The tension between the insiders and the outsiders in the Trump transition team is likely to continue well into his presidency. Read more about Betsy DeVos Secretary of Education nominee Nikki Haley United Nations Ambassador nominee The loyalists The first Trump Cabinet nominee to be announced, Senator Jeff Sessions for attorney general, was also one of the first national politicians to endorse the New Yorker s presidential campaign. Donald Trump receives the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions at a rally in August .Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions took a chance on Donald Trump and was rewarded for it Several high profile Trump political donors and advisers also were handed top positions, including Mr Mnuchin, Mr Ross and Mr Puzder. Linda McMahon, who gave more than m to the Trump campaign and affiliated political groups, is his pick to head the Small Business Administration. She is also the largest donor to the Trump family s charitable foundation. Another Trump donor, Todd Ricketts, has landed a deputy position in the Commerce Department. Meanwhile, some early, outspoken Trump advocates were passed over for plum positions including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. They emerged from the political graveyard to take an early gamble on Mr Trump, but they have yet to be rewarded for their efforts. What we ve learned While fiery speeches and television appearances are nice, one of the quickest ways to Mr Trump s corridors of power appears to be with an open chequebook.",

        "text": "The Obama administration is preparing to announce a response, which may include cyber operations, to the alleged Russian interference in last month s election, according to a Washington Post report citing anonymous U.S. officials. The report says that details are still being finalized but are likely to include new economic sanctions. President Obama has said that his administration would respond to Russian meddling in the U.S. election. I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action and we will at a time and a place of our own choosing, Mr. Obama told NPR s Steve Inskeep earlier this month. Some of it may be ... explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be. Intelligence officials believed Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic servers last summer. Russia dismisses the charges. Ian Bremmer on impact of Russia hack, China drone controversy A executive order, as intended, gives the president the authority to respond to foreign cyberattacks. However, officials concluded that the order did not give the president authority to respond to Russian meddling in American elections, prompting a last ditch effort within the administration to expand the president s authority on the matter. According to the Post, officials are also trying to figure out ways to make it difficult for president elect Trump, who has frequently spoken of improving relations with Russia, from diminishing any response from the Obama administration. Part of the goal here is to make sure that we have as much of the record public or communicated to Congress in a form that would be difficult to simply walk back, the Post quotes a senior administration official as saying. The announcement of the response could come as early as this week, the paper states. Officials quoted in the story say they hope to create a deterrent against future election meddling by other nations. As much as I am concerned about what happened to us in the election, I am also concerned about what will happen to us in the future, the Post quotes an administration official as saying. I am firmly convinced that the Russians and others will say, That worked pretty well in , so let s keep going. We have elections every two years in this country. ",

In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump said he was doing his best to disregard the inflammatory statements and roadblocks from Mr. Obama Mr. Trump was presumably still responding to Mr. Obama s comments in a podcast interview released Monday, in which he said he would have been able to mobilize Americans against Mr. Trump had he been able to run for a third term in . I am confident in this vision because I m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it, Mr. Obama said in the interview with David Axelrod, his former senior political advisor, which was released on Axelrod s podcast AxeFiles.

I probably thought that maybe I wouldn t, but I did. I really enjoyed him a lot. But as Inauguration Day approaches, it appears that goodwill is not going to last. Mr. Trump has been critical of several of Mr. Obama s recent decisions, including the abstention on the United Nations Security Council vote condemning Israeli settlements. Mr. Obama, too, has offered veiled criticisms of Mr. Trump in recent public speeches and appearances. For example, speaking aside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that even when hatred burns hottest, even when the tug of tribalism is at its most primal, we must resist the urge to turn inward.

        "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. A businessman who co chaired the Trump campaign in New York state said Tuesday his recent derogatory statements about President Barack Obama and his wife weren t meant for publication but were nevertheless inappropriate and a mistake. Carl Paladino said he intended his email response to a weekly alternative publication s survey to only go to a couple friends, not the newspaper. He said he mistakenly hit reply on his computer instead of forward. The millionaire developer told Artvoice last week he hoped President Obama would die from mad cow disease and Michelle Obama would return to being a male. In Paladino s Tuesday statement, first reported on Buffalo s WBEN radio, he apologizes to minorities, saying he never intended to hurt them with his anti Obama remarks. The comments sparked outrage from various political circles, including Trump s transition team, which called the developer s comments absolutely reprehensible. Paladino s comments even drew a rebuke from his own son William, who runs the family s development firm. The younger Paladino called the statements disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary. The father s earlier comments about the president prompted at least two petitions, one calling for his removal from the Buffalo school board and the other seeking the removal of his name from a student town house at St. Bonaventure University, his alma mater and recipient of more than million in donations from Carl Paladino over the years. Paladino, a school board member since , also said he won t resign his elected position on the board. No, I m not leaving the school board, he said in the statement, not when it s time to help implement the real choice elements of Trump s plan for education reform. The board is holding a special meeting Thursday to discuss board member conduct. In New York, school board members typically can only be removed by the state education commissioner. Paladino, , unsuccessfully ran for governor in as a Republican. The Democrat who defeated him, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, called the comments about the Obamas racist, ugly and reprehensible. Paladino made the comments Friday in response to an Artvoice survey that asked local artists, performers and business owners for their New Year s wish list. Asked what he would most like to happen in , Paladino responded that he hoped Obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a cow, dies and is buried in a cow pasture. Asked who he would like to see go away, he said Michelle Obama. I d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla, he wrote. In an emailed statement to the AP, Paladino, , claimed his comments had nothing to do with race but instead reflected his opinion of the president s performance in office. Merry Christmas and tough luck if you don t like my answer, he wrote. As recently as August, Paladino falsely claimed Mr. Obama was not Christian, telling the New York Observer that to average Americans, There is no doubt he is a Muslim. And in , Paladino was criticized after it was revealed he had forwarded to friends racially charged emails that depicted Mr. Obama as a pimp. Paladino made no mention of any computer mistakes in a statement he released Friday after the publication posted his comments on its website. Instead, that statement ripped the Obamas, calling the president a yellow bellied coward and claiming the first lady hated America before her husband won the White House.",

With the U.S. expected to participate in an international peace conference in France next month and Secretary of State John Kerry planning a final policy speech, the Palestinians said they were hoping to capitalize on the momentum from the Security Council vote. The U.N. vote s impact on U.S. Israel relations Play VIDEO The U.N. vote s impact on U.S. Israel relations Although the U.S. has long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied lands, it has traditionally used its veto in the U.N. Security Council to protect its ally Israel from international censure. But in a change of policy, it abstained from Friday s vote, allowing the resolution to pass by a margin. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long had a cool relationship with President Barack Obama, has called the resolution shameful and accused the U.S. of playing a leading role in its passage. On Tuesday, his spokesman went even further. We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, David Keyes said. We re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night as the Obama administration helps push such a grave resolution, he said. How U.N. resolution against Israel will impact U.S. relations Play VIDEO How U.N. resolution against Israel will impact U.S. relations He did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information. Israel has close security ties with Egypt, an original sponsor of last week s resolution. Under heavy Israeli pressure, Egypt delayed the resolution last week before other council members presented it for a vote a day later. Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measure. Keyes claim mirrors that of his boss Netanyahu, who told his Cabinet on Sunday From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed. Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians, with overwhelming world support, claim for their state. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U.S. abstention, saying, We would not have let this resolution pass if it hadn t addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians. And she added that the vote does not in any way diminish the United States steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel. Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state, which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace, CBS News Margaret Brennan reports. The United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop, privately and publicly, for nearly five decades, Power said. Israel s recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahu s hand the incoming Trump Administration. In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines, Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U.S. veto. After the vote, Trump vowed that things will be different after Jan. th. Critically, he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements, his longtime attorney David Friedman, as ambassador to Israel. And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which even many Israelis fear could spark violence. The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites, as the capital of the future state to which they aspire. After Friday s vote, Netanyahu s office said he looked forward to working with Trump to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution. It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do. While he will be able to wield the U.S. veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council, mustering enough votes to overturn Friday s decision appears to be impossible. The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions, which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country. Israel has said the law doesn t apply because the territory was captured from Jordan, which has renounced all claims to the land. Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds. When Netanyahu s rivals in Israel oppose the settlements, it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand, but rather for concern for Israel s democracy. If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank, it will have to grant its . million Palestinians voting rights, or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy. The country is toxically divided on the issue, and key sectors of society, including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment, want to see settlements end. Many of them welcome some openly, and many more quietly any world pressure to bring that about. Dan Miodownik, a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University, said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution. He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps, meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal. And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past, Israel was no longer being forced to defend its right to exist. ",

        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Donald Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are probing whether the president elect personally benefited from its spending, the New York attorney general s office said Tuesday. The Trump foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete, said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office Jan. . But the foundation s inner workings have been the subject of Schneiderman s investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trump s incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trump s global business empire during his presidency. Trump s charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation. President elect announces he will shutter Trump Foundation The admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were in a tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a , political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties. The tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. by someone using an email address from the foundation s law firm, Morgan, Lewis Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci. In the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during , but in prior years. But the tax filing doesn t provide details on the violations. Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by The Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundation s purchases. Trump asserted on Twitter late Monday that his foundation was run efficiently. The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses, the president elect tweeted. of the money goes to wonderful charities. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON Republicans are united on repealing President Barack Obama s health care law, but ideologically and practically speaking, they re in different camps over replacing it. Getting the factions together won t be easy. Some Republicans would revise and rebrand Obamacare, junking unpopular provisions like its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, while preserving well liked parts. Others would rip up the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and not replace it. Can Congress put aside differences in the new year? Play VIDEO Can Congress put aside differences in the new year? President elect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders will have to unite the groups on complicated changes affecting the financial and physical well being of millions of people. For some constituents in fragile health, it s literally a life and death debate. Republicans have a really narrow path, says Grace Marie Turner of the Galen Institute, a free market health care research organization. They ve got to deal with the politics of this, they ve got to make sure they come up with good policy, and they also have process challenges. Success is not guaranteed, and Republicans may come to regret that their party defined itself as totally opposed to Obamacare. Yet House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady seems unfazed by the challenge. It s like tax reform, says Brady, a Texas Republican, explaining that many pieces will be pulled together. Unlike Obamacare, which ripped up the individual market, this will be done deliberately, in an appropriate timetable. Republicans say they will move quickly to repeal the ACA, while suspending the effective date to allow them to craft a replacement. Here s a look at the GOP camps and who s in them Revise and rebrand Many Republicans may quietly be in this contingent, but fear being accused of promoting Obamacare lite. They d strip out some of the ACA s taxes and requirements. The unpopular individual mandate to carry health insurance or risk fines could be replaced with other persuasion short of a government dictate. Rules on insurers would be loosened. But popular provisions such as protecting those with pre existing health conditions would be retained in some form, as well as financial assistance for low and moderate income people. The requirement that health plans cover adult children until age would be fairly easy to preserve, since employers have accommodated it. A rebranded version of Obama s law may well cover fewer people. But its GOP advocates believe most Americans will find their goal of universal access to care politically acceptable when measured against the Democratic ideal of universal coverage, underwritten by government. Many GOP allies in the business community favor revising the ACA. That includes major players among hospitals, insurers and pharmaceuticals. Trump may have given this group some cover by saying that he wants to keep parts of the law, but his bottom line remains unknown. Budget hawks For budget hawks, unwinding the Obama health law is a beginning. Next they could move on to much bigger objectives like restructuring Medicaid and Medicare, and placing a cost conscious limit on tax breaks for employer coverage. Budget hawks see health care as the main driver of government deficits, and they are loath to address that imbalance by raising taxes. Instead they want to rewrite the social compact so individuals accept more responsibility and risk for their health care. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the most prominent member of this camp, and his Better Way agenda is its roadmap. Georgia Rep. Tom Price, Trump s nominee for Health and Human Services, is a budget hawk. Vice President elect Mike Pence has been in the same orbit throughout his career. The problem for budget hawks is that the political campaign did not give them a mandate. Issues like Medicare and Medicaid were scarcely discussed. Trump said he wouldn t cut Medicare, and sent conflicting signals on Medicaid. Many Democrats can t wait for Republicans to follow the call of the budget hawks. Betting that will backfire, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is rallying her lawmakers against attacks on the ACA and Medicare. The rip it up society The most conservative lawmakers want to pull Obamacare up by the roots as if it never existed, says Republican political consultant Frank Luntz. That sentiment is embodied by the or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, and it s probably broadly shared among conservatives. Some do not believe the federal government should be involved in health care, and they couldn t care less about replacing the ACA. They would say that Obama s plan has failed, said Luntz. GOP leaders may need these lawmakers to advance on replacement legislation coaxing them to a middle ground might not be possible. Trump calls the ACA a disaster, and that s pleasing to those farthest on the right. It s unclear if he d walk their walk. Pragmatists At the core of this small group are legislative veterans who understand the excruciating difficulties of getting major bills to a president s desk. GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are pragmatists. They may find support from Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law. GOP congressional leaders could gravitate to this camp. The biggest challenge for pragmatists will be to win over some Democrats for replacement legislation. While repealing most of Obamacare is possible with a simple majority in the Senate, votes would probably be needed for a replacement. There will only be GOP senators next year. Republicans need a fancy Rose Garden repeal ceremony...and I expect them to have one, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the consulting firm Avalere Health. On the other hand, there s million people with health insurance under the ACA, and they don t want to dump them. There s no clear path for how to square that conflict. ",

Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back THE TWO WAY Trump Plans To Dissolve His Foundation N.Y. Attorney General Pushes Back And in doing so, Trump incorrectly stated the charitable reach of the Donald J. Trump Foundation. In a series of tweets Monday evening, Trump said he had given millions to the foundation he began in and that all of the money raised went to wonderful charities. I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won t report! Donald J. Trump realDonaldTrump December , The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. of money goes to wonderful charities! Donald J. Trump realDonaldTrump December , But extensive reporting over the past year has shown those claims to be overstated. According to the Washington Post s David Fahrenthold, who has researched the foundation s donations and expenses for several months, Trump and his companies have given about million to the charity since its launch, according to tax records up to . However, the president elect has not given anything to the foundation from until his businesses gave to the foundation in for the first time in several years, according to the Post. In fact, the two largest donors were professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave million to the foundation from until . Trump has nominated Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration. And as Fahrenthold reported during the campaign, not all of the money was solely for charitable purposes. In many cases, spending benefited Trump and his business interests. Trump used his foundation s money to buy a foot tall portrait of himself for , , and had earlier bought another portrait for , , the Post s reporting showed. He also used the foundation s money to buy an autographed Tim Tebow Denver Broncos helmet for , . Trump tapped his foundation to help settle lawsuits for his businesses. In one case, Palm Beach, Fla., agreed to forgive fines for Trump s Mar a Lago Club if he made a , donation to a veterans charity. In another instance, Trump settled a case involving one of his New York golf courses to make a , donation to a charity of the plaintiff s choosing. So if Trump is using this money basically to save his businesses, the money isn t helping people. That s a violation of the letter and the spirit of law, Fahrenthold told NPR s All Things Considered on Sunday. Trump announced on Christmas Eve that to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways. But Trump cannot shutter the foundation just yet since it s under investigation by the New York attorney general, according to the office s spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop raising money in New York in October, saying it wasn t registered by law to be able to do so in the state. And last year Trump had to pay a , fine to the IRS when he used , of the foundation s money to donate to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, she was weighing whether or not to pursue an investigation into Trump University ultimately, she decided not to, and this year was a vocal surrogate for Trump. RealClearPolitics also reported in October that many of the Trump Foundation s donations in recent years went to top conservative or policy groups that could aid Trump as he prepared for a White House run. Saving Lives Or Selling Access ? Explaining The Clinton Foundation POLITICS Saving Lives Or Selling Access ? Explaining The Clinton Foundation Throughout the campaign, Trump took sharp aim at his opponent Hillary Clinton s own family foundation, claiming it was a pay to play vehicle for the Democratic nominee and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office, Trump said at an August rally in Texas. They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money. Those claims have not been borne out by evidence. In August, the Clintons vowed to drastically reduce the size of their foundation to avoid appearances of conflict. They denied any insinuation of pay to play and defended the work of the Clinton Foundation. At the time, RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, If everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing? But now it s Trump and his family who have come under fire for some of the same alleged behaviors. An AP investigation found that Trump s son Eric has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity s payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump s private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships. My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with... Donald J. Trump realDonaldTrump December , my presidency. Isn t this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer! Donald J. Trump realDonaldTrump December , Eric Trump announced last week he would also close his personal foundation after it was auctioning off a coffee with his sister, Ivanka, who is expected to have considerable influence in her father s White House. The president elect also tweeted about that last Friday, saying it was a ridiculous shame that Eric would have to stop fundraising for his foundation, which gave much of its money to St. Jude Children s Research Hospital. Back in October, NPR s Joel Rose compared the Trump and Clinton foundations and found some marked differences. While the Clinton Foundation does have hundreds of employees and a large budget, it spent almost cents of every dollar received on charitable causes, such as HIV and malaria prevention in Africa. It s a public charity, meaning it mostly raises money from other people and organizations including a gift from the Trump Foundation in . And while it did accept money from foreign donors, some of whom wanted meetings when Clinton was secretary of state, there s no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the State Department, Rose reported. The Trump Foundation is a private foundation, originally intended to give away Trump s own money. But, as noted earlier, he stopped making personal contributions about eight years ago. The Trump Foundation has engaged in documented, flagrant acts of violation, said Pamela Mann, a former head of the charities bureau in the New York attorney general s office, told Rose. That s really different. ",

In an interview with NPR s Allison Aubrey Sunday, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold provided context. The Donald J.

So he was already under investigation by the New York Attorney General for apparently violating a number of federal laws that govern charities.

There s nothing out of the ordinary here, Putin said, since the U.S. president elect had advocated a stronger military throughout his election campaign. The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes Donald J. Trump realDonaldTrump December , Putin took a deep dive into U.S. politics on Friday during his annual news conference in Moscow, praising Trump and skewering President Obama and Hillary Clinton. During a marathon Q A session that lasted almost four hours, reporters kept returning to the accusations of Kremlin interference in the U.S. presidential election. Putin took them on with gusto, at times sounding like a Trump surrogate. The current administration and the Democratic Party leadership are trying to blame all their failures on external factors, Putin said. The Russian president said he agreed with Trump that anybody even someone lying on their sofa could have hacked the Democratic National Committee. The most important thing, according to Putin, is the information that came out of the hack, namely the machinations among top Democrats. America s ruling party, he said, has clearly forgotten the original meaning of the word democratic. The fact that a growing number of Republicans has a favorable view of Putin shows that a significant portion of Americans shares the concerns and traditional values of Russians, Putin said, adding that mutual sympathy could be the basis for closer relations in the future. He took issue with Obama s assertion last week that late Republican President Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave because of Putin s popularity in the GOP. On the contrary, Putin said, Reagan would be happy that Republicans are winning everywhere and had Trump, who understood the mood of the people. He went all the way, even though only we believed that he would win, Putin said to laughter and applause. On Friday, Trump said in a statement that he received a very nice letter from Putin, adding that his thoughts are so correct. In an indication that he s through with Obama, Putin said it s more likely that great Democrats are turning over in their graves. Unlike President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who united Americans, the outgoing administration divided them, Putin said.

        "text": "President elect Donald Trump s transition team has asked the State Department to list its workers who focus on gender equality and ending violence against women, in what s being seen as an echo of an earlier request for the Energy Department to list employees who work on climate change. In a brief email that was sent Wednesday morning, the Trump team asked the State Department s bureaus and offices to list any programs or activities that promote gender equality, such as ending gender based violence, promoting women s participation in economic and political spheres, entrepreneurship, etc. The email was acquired and published by The New York Times, which reports Although the wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change, it rattled State Department employees, even those at senior levels. Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, though the memo did not refer to them. The team also asked the department offices to note positions whose primary functions are to promote such issues and to highlight any funds for the current financial year that are already allocated to such programs and activities. Affirming the Times characterization of the email s reception, The Los Angeles Times quotes a senior State Department official who said, People are freaked out. Update a.m. ET Friday Trump Team s Response In a statement about the request, the Trump transition team says President elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected. To help fulfill this promise, the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality, ends gender based violence, and promotes economic and political participation finding ways to improve them, along with hundreds of other requests. Our original post continues The topic also came up at Thursday s daily State Department briefing but NPR s Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the request. In a report for our Newscast unit, Michele quotes Kirby as saying, To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team, we will certainly provide them the context, the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forward. Kirby acknowledged that there could be anxiety at a time of transition, but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documents. Addressing his agency s approach to gender issues, Kirby told a reporter, Obviously, gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority. Secretary Kerry has made them a priority Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority, and it remains one for us here. Kirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities, saying that in a hypothetical case, if there were issue specific names requested, obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed along. Shortly after the transition team s email became public, the Twitter account of the State Department s Political Military Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, Security a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday, as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by President Obama. In response to reports about the memo, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D N.H., who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement saying in part In light of previous requests made by the Trump transition team, today s report that the incoming administration is requesting all information related to State Department programs that promote gender equality is concerning and the transition team should clarify their intent.... Women and girls equality is transformative for communities and economies, and the existing State Department programs have achieved great successes to advance education access for girls, protect women from trafficking, end child marriage, and combat gender based violence. The Trump team s request, which set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon to produce the lists, comes one week after the Energy Department rebuffed a request from Trump s transition team to name employees working on climate change. As NPR s Brakkton Booker has reported, the Trump team s point questionnaire on climate change raised fears among civil rights lawyers specializing in federal worker whistleblower protections, who say the incoming administration is at a minimum trying to influence or limit the research. In refusing the Trump team s request, the Energy Department said many of its staff members were unsettled by the gesture, stating that while it would share any information that was already public, it would not produce a list of individual names. Early last week, Trump said he is nominating Exxon Mobil Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson to lead the State Department.",

Jammeh has ruled the tiny West African country since seizing power in a coup in , and his public concession to President elect Adama Barrow on Dec. led to hopes of the first peaceful transition of power in Gambia since it became independent from the U.K. in . On Friday, Jammeh said the Independent Electoral Commission made errors in vote tallies. In the same way that I accepted faithfully the results, believing that the IEC was independent and honest and reliable, I hereby reject the results in totality, Jammeh said in a televised speech. He also said there were other irregularities and problems in the electoral process. Our investigations reveal that in some cases, voters were told that the opposition has already won and there was no need for them to vote, Jammeh said. Last week, supporters of the opposition took to the streets to celebrate Barrow s win. Jammeh s allegations are now plunging Gambia into confusion and uncertainty, NPR s Ofeibea Quist Arcton reports. President elect Barrow responded, telling reporters, The outgoing president has no constitutional authority to reject the result of the election and order for fresh elections to be held, Reuters reports. I urge him to change his current position and accept the verdict of the people in good faith for the sake of the Gambia, our homeland, whose people deserve peace and freedom and prosperity, he added to The Associated Press. The U.S. joined international bodies in condemning the announcement.

Human rights groups have criticized Jammeh for abuses during his year rule. In its report, Human Rights Watch said his government frequently committed serious human rights violations including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture against those who voiced opposition to the government, creating a climate of fear within Gambia. On Saturday, the organization retweeted a statement from deputy program director Babatunde Olugboji saying they were deeply concerned. Diplomats told Reuters that it s unclear what international organizations plan to do, but there is a precedent for military intervention.

        "text": "Senate Democrats dropped their objections Friday night to a short term funding bill to keep the government running, and the bill passed less than an hour before the midnight deadline. It s become a familiar year end act for Congress passing a short term funding bill that will keep the government running for a few more months. This funding measure, which passed , runs out in April. Despite overwhelming support in the House on Thursday, the spending package hit a roadblock in the Senate, where coal state Democrats staged a late protest to try to alter provisions affecting miners. The stopgap includes million to continue health benefits for four months for certain retired coal miners, whose coverage was set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats, led by West Virginia s Joe Manchin, wanted a full year extension, but with little leverage and a shutdown looming, they relented with a promise to reignite that fight in four months. Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But we ll be back at it in April, and I think it s highly unlikely that we ll take it away. With House lawmakers already back home for the holidays on Friday and zero interest from GOP leaders to reopen negotiations Democrats backed down in time to avert a midnight Friday shutdown. The spending bill keeps the federal government running on autopilot until April . Congressional Republicans opted to punt the annual spending bills into next year to wait until President elect Donald Trump assumes office. With control of both the White House and Congress, Republicans will have more sway over how roughly trillion is spent on federal agencies and programs. The bill runs through April to buy Congress more time to negotiate the fiscal year spending bills, because the Senate is expected to be consumed by the confirmation process for Trump administration nominees in the first quarter of next year. Since the spending bill is a must pass measure, it also includes some unrelated provisions and additional funding measures. For instance, Senate Republicans included language that will help expedite the confirmation process for Trump s defense secretary nominee, retired Gen. James Mattis. For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress must waive a law that requires a seven year cooling off period for current or former military officials to hold that Cabinet post. Mattis retired in . Democrats objected to the language, but Republicans said it was necessary to expedite consideration of a critical administration post. The waiver will still be reviewed by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and it will need to pass a vote threshold in the Senate. Mattis has been widely praised on both sides of the aisle and is expected to be confirmed, barring something unforeseen coming to light during the confirmation process. The measure also includes just over billion in Overseas Contingency Funding, better known as the side Pentagon account that funds the ongoing war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. An additional . billion is directed to disaster relief, including recovery efforts from Hurricane Matthew. Democrats also secured funding to assist the Flint, Mich., community with repairing its drinking water systems. Some million is directed toward infrastructure improvements and preventive care against lead poisoning for mothers and children. Congress approved a biomedical research bill this week, and the stopgap spending measure includes funds for new programs authorized in the legislation, such as million to the National Institutes of Health for medical research and million to states to combat the opioid epidemic. The measure also includes a provision that will prevent a pay raise for members of Congress. The pay freeze has been in place since .",

        "text": "As debate about Obamacare s future moves from people s general, mostly partisan views of the Affordable Care Act to details and consequences of plans to repeal and replace the ACA, one of the biggest flash points is likely to be how people with pre existing medical conditions are affected. Across the U.S., people who have cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or other serious conditions will want to know whether they or their sick family members will be able to get and afford coverage in the future. Their partisan views about Obamacare are likely to quickly be supplanted by these more practical concerns. And a substantial number of people could be affected. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis to be released next week found that almost of U.S. adults younger than have health conditions that would have left them uninsurable in a pre ACA world. Many more people have conditions with which they could still qualify for coverage before ACA protections took effect but only at premiums they could not afford. Many people with conditions over which coverage could be declined before the ACA live in big red states there are more than million in Texas, for example and in blue states nearly million in California . As the chart above shows, however, the states with the largest shares of adults who have pre existing conditions are all controlled by Republicans, and most are in the South. These states have higher rates of residents with conditions over which coverage was declined before the ACA, such as obesity and diabetes. Still, even more Americans may feel that they have a stake in policies regarding pre existing conditions. Kaiser s monthly health tracking poll found in August that of Americans said that they or a family member had a pre existing condition after being read a definition of the term. Most people with pre existing conditions are insured at any given time through employer plans or public programs such as Medicaid. Before the ACA, however, they would have been unable to get coverage again if they lost their insurance through a change in circumstances. Because so many people with a pre existing condition have to worry about whether their circumstances might change someday, a much larger share of the public is likely to be interested in this issue than the number of people who stand to be affected immediately by policy changes. President elect Donald Trump has said that he wants to protect people who have pre existing medical conditions. Details of Republican health care plans are not yet known, but they are expected to involve establishing high risk pools within states, among other measures. Without the plan details it is hard to say how strong protections will be. Tens of millions of people with pre existing medical conditions and the influential groups that represent them will be interested in details of legislative plans to change the ACA and how they might be affected. It s sometimes said that this has become a post factual world. But as health care moves from a campaign issue to the legislative agenda, people will want to know how changes would affect them, and details and facts will matter more again. ",

        "text": "Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul gave an indication today of the trouble that President elect Trump may face from his own party in trying to fulfill campaign promises that cost money. The former GOP presidential candidate said on ABC News This Week that he won t vote for a budget that never balances and that he is working to find a few other conservative GOP senators to join him. The current budget that the Republicans are looking at never balances. How can that be fiscally responsible? And how can we look at the public with a straight face and say, yes, we ran on balanced budgets, we re for the balanced budget amendment, and yet the budget we re going to introduce, that we re going to repeal Obamacare with never balances? Paul said. Trump this week repeated his promise that he wants a trillion dollar infrastructure program and he promised during the campaign to repeal Obamacare. Paul said that with the help of other conservative senators he might be able to block a budget that he considers irresponsible. All it takes is a couple of us. If there are a few conservatives in the Senate wing of the Republican Party that will say no to a budget that never balances, we could have the power to say to the leadership, you know what, we need a better budget, Paul said. I don t know if it will happen, but I know that I will be one that won t vote for a budget that never balances, he said. Paul also addressed reports that ExxonMobile CEO Rex Tillerson has emerged as a likely pick for secretary of state, saying that he is going to reserve judgment on Tillerson. But the Kentucky senator had strong warnings about former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, who is a possible contender for secretary of state or deputy secretary of state. I ll do anything to try to prevent John Bolton from getting any position because I think his world view is naive, Paul said. He still believes in regime change. He s still a big cheerleader for the Iraq War. He s promoted a nuclear attack by Israel on Iran. He wants to do regime change in Iran. John Bolton doesn t get it, Paul said.",

        "text": "Like many foreign scientists in Britain, Joanna Bagniewska was devastated when Britons voted to leave the European Union. The biology lecturer, a Polish migrant who found Britain a welcoming place to build her academic career over a decade, is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air. I m worried that after my current contract finishes, one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card, she said. I d like to apply for EU grant money, but how much longer will it be available for? Britain s top universities have long been among the world s most sought after destinations for study and research, drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe. But since Britons voted in June to leave the nation EU, many in the science community say the U.K. risks losing the money, the international influence and crucially, the talent to sustain that enviable position. More than one tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years. Some fields such as nanotechnology and cancer research are more dependent on EU funding than others, according to a report by technology firm Digital Science. From to , Britain received . billion euros . billion in direct EU investment in research. Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself she s upset for her students future too, for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted. They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph.Ds in other countries. And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled, she said. Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries. The bloc s freedom of movement means its million people can live and work visa free in any member state. No one knows yet what form Britain s exit from the EU commonly known as Brexit is going to take, but immigration was a key issue for Leave voters. Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders. She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain, an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the , Europeans who make up percent of the academic workforce in British universities. Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield. Scientists for EU, an advocacy group, says it has received over letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work. Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers. Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold. One said their employer, a London university, immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze, citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income. Adam Durrant, a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers, says he s now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain. Part of the reason, he says, is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before. In the future, it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U.K. to work, said Durrant. There s a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future. I will certainly retain a U.K. presence, but my company s focus of gravity may shift elsewhere. Scientists say some U.K. based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues. Paul Crowther, head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield, said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum. The vote put the U.K. based researchers in a very awkward position and their participation in EU funded programs could compromise the project, he was told. The erosion of U.K. involvement in EU networks has already begun, with both the U.K. and EU science worse off, Crowther said. Apart from a loss of grant money, Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure. Large scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases, the building of large facilities, are areas that multinational collaborations do much better, said Venki Ramakrishnan, a Nobel Prize winning biologist and president of Britain s prestigious Royal Society. The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain, which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science. In , Britain s government spent under . percent of its GDP on research below the European average, and half that of South Korea. May s government is clearly aware of the jitters. She has promised to increase annual investment in research by billion pounds . billion by , in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation. Durrant is doubtful that s enough to make a big difference. Two billion a year spread across everything isn t going to go very far, he said. Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level. The , European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans. Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year but no one knows what will happen after that. Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain s most competitive university courses, including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge. In September, the admission service UCAS reported a percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in . Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland, an associate EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects. It s not all doom and gloom but it will be harder, Ramakrishnan said. We could make a go of it outside the EU. But for that to happen, we have to attract talent and fund science. And those two things are critical. ",

        "text": "Donald Trump said again on Sunday that he is open minded about climate change but also that nobody really knows the truth about the issue, which contradicts the fact that there is near universal scientific agreement on the issue. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, moderator Chris Wallace pointed out to Mr. Trump that in the space of a week he bothmet with former Vice President Al Gore and appointed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change denier who has opposed many environmental regulations, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Where, Wallace asked, does Mr. Trump stands on climate change? I m very open minded. I m still open minded, he said. Nobody really knows. However, there is a near universal scientific consensus that climate change is a real phenomenon despite continued opposition to the notion among primarily Republican politicians. NASA s website on climate change, for example, notes that approximately percent of publishing climate scientists agree that human activities are very likely responsible for rising temperatures. His comments came just days after his transition team created a questionnaire with questions for Energy Department officials to identify employees who had been involved in international climate talks over the last five years, as well as employees who have helped develop Obama administration climate policies. The questionnaire, obtained by CBS News and first reported by Bloomberg News, asks, for example, Which programs within the Department of Energy are essential to meeting the goals of President Obama s Climate Action Plan? Mr. Trump s answer Sunday on the climate change issue is similar to the one he gave in a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times last month after a campaign in which Mr. Trump repeatedly insisted climate change was a hoax invented by China. I have a very open mind, he said at the time. And I m going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and we re going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. Still, Mr. Trump said his reason for choosing Pruitt whom many environmental groups immediately blasted was to speed up the process for permit approvals and other EPA business. If you look at what China s doing. If you look at what I could name country after country, he said. You look at what s happening in Mexico where our people are just plants are being built and they don t wait years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? They build it like the following day or the following week. We can t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs. As for the Paris Agreement, the landmark international climate agreement that went into effect this fall, Mr. Trump said he is studying the agreement but that he worries it will put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage. International energy and environment experts worry that Mr. Trump, who said earlier this year that he would tear up the Paris deal, could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy. Paris, I m studying, he said. I do say this I don t want that agreement to put us at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. And as you know, there are different times and different time limits on that agreement. I don t want that to give China, or other countries signing agreements an advantage over us. ",

        "text": "Republicans on Capitol Hill are already laying the groundwork for a rapid repeal of President Obama s signature health care law beginning on the first day of the new Congress, before President elect Donald Trump is even sworn in. But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it, and how long a transition period to allow before the law s insurance would go away. Hard liners are pushing to move as fast as possible, bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises. But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago, sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far, too fast. While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom, a full replacement could take months, if not years. I d like to do it tomorrow, but reality is another matter sometimes, said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch R Utah , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the repeal and replace efforts. We have to live with the real world. And the real world right now is that the Democrats won t help with anything. S Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, once he gets into office. Now that he s won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate, that feat might not prove to be too easy. Wonkblog s Max Ehrenfreund explains. Daron Taylor The Washington Post Hatch and other high ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until or beyond, allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections. Many of them, like Sen. Susan Collins R Maine , have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly. I don t want to leave the , people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because, all of a sudden, two thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy, Collins said. But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues many of them sent to Congress in the midterm, anti Obama waves of and who see little reason to dawdle. The history of this place is, the longer it takes, the more exponentially the probability grows that it ll never get done, said Rep. Mark Meadows R N.C. , elected recently as the new chairman of the hard right House Freedom Caucus. Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years, so why do we need three years? Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan, despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now. Their foot dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits. Trump has also been vague, promising a terrific replacement that will provide great health care at a fraction of the cost. The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacare s sunset. But other fights loom over what precisely a replacement plan should look like, whether Obamacare s Medicaid expansion will continue, whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare, and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky. has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan. . Jonathan Ernst Reuters The battle lines, however, are familiar, with establishment Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents, mainly in the House, on the other. Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A. Boehner R Ohio to retire. Come Jan. , Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans, and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health care overhaul, the real fight will occur inside the GOP. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky. has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan. . But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets. So far, Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace, but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute. We re going to repeal Obamacare lock, stock and barrel, Vice President elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently. The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people. Hard liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep. Tom Price R Ga. , Trump s pick for health and human services secretary, as allies in their push for quick and decisive action. Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill with all deliberate speed but pledged only to then set into motion a process to replace it. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan R Wis. said Thursday that Republicans would move as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people. Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing. The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace, he said. Conservative activists who pushed a take no prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited. When Republicans have the House, the Senate and the White House, you don t wait, said Adam Brandon, president and chief executive of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group. I m a Cleveland Indians fan. I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades. When you have a shot to do it, you do it. That s it. Democrats and many health care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges. More than million Americans are covered under those policies. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacare s insurance exchanges, according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed door meeting. Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue, because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers, providers, consumers and states, Burwell told reporters after the meeting. Republicans want to end Obamacare s system of penalties and subsidies. But many including Trump want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick. Experts warn that repeal and delay under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market. Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said insurers could face as much as billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated. That billion is the tip of the iceberg, Blumberg said. With all of these changes and the uncertainty, it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get. Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments, something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers. The insurance industry should understand that there s a new sheriff in town, said Rep. Ken Buck R Colo. , a Freedom Caucus member. They signed up for Obamacare, and if they want to make a profit, they re going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free market insurance industry. The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base, but also Senate arithmetic. There will be a slim to Republican majority come January, and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules, passing a complete replacement will require votes. Only by dismantling Obamacare first, Republicans say, will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so. We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all, Hatch said. Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer D N.Y. , however, has rejected that strategy. We re not going to do a replacement. If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it, he told The Washington Post recently. But the Republican base, prodded by conservative media outlets and well organized activist groups, has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction. One prominent activist, Jenny Beth Martin, co founder of the Tea Party Patriots, suggested that Trump could goose the repeal and replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to , congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law. I don t think anyone thinks that you re going to flip a switch .?.?. but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly, she said. We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done. Brandon was even blunter This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans, but tough cookies , he said. They re going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers, and guess what? It s hard. The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place, he added. The old excuses of having divided government, they re gone. A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit. They have to look at the complexity of the problem here, and hopefully they ll recognize that it s not quite so simple, said Sen. Ron Johnson R Wis. , who was first elected in the tea party wave. But many others are not. Literally every Republican member has made this part of their platform in running for Congress, said Rep. Mark Walker R N.C. , a first termer who will chair the conservative Republican Study Committee next year. We ve got to act on it. ",

        "text": "Two Senate Republicans joined demands for a bipartisan probe into Russia s suspected election interference allegedly designed to bolster Donald Trump as questions continue to mount about the president elect s expected decision to nominate a secretary of state candidate with close ties to Russia. Sens. Lindsey O. Graham R S.C. and John McCain R Ariz. the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee joined calls by incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer N.Y. and Armed Services ranking Democrat Jack Reed R.I. for a thorough, bipartisan investigation of Russian influence in the U.S. elections. Their statement came two days after The Washington Post reported the CIA s private conclusion that Russia s activities were intended to tip the scales to help Trump. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American, the four senators said in a statement on Sunday morning. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks. This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. We are committed to working in this bipartisan manner, and we will seek to unify our colleagues around the goal of investigating and stopping the grave threats that cyberattacks conducted by foreign governments pose to our national security, they added. Republican senators John McCain Arizona and Lindsey Graham South Carolina have been highly have been highly critical of Donald Trump s comments about Russia. Michael Reynolds EPA But McCain and Graham who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election have often bucked Republican leaders, and their embrace of a wide ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky. . Sen. Susan Collins Maine , one of the more moderate Republicans in the upper chamber, suggested a bipartisan investigation may be useful toward achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries. The purpose of any investigation, whether by the Obama administration or Congress, is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present Presidential election, she said in a statement. Instead, any review must focus on the long overdue task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyber attacks, including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaign. Another GOP senator Sen. James Lankford Okla. , who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee agreed with McCain and Graham s decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U.S. elections. Cybersecurity investigation of Russian interference can t be partisan, Lankford tweeted Sunday. Meanwhile, the Senate Intelligence Committee s chairman, Richard Burr R N.C. , said Sunday that the panel will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of all intelligence matters. But he made no specific mention of Russia, unlike Sen. Ron Johnson R Wis. said cyber threats by America s rivals, including Russia, pose serious challenges that should not be politicized or viewed through a partisan lens. Johnson said as chairman Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel he would continue to hold hearings based on fact not innuendo for the sole purpose of informing effective policy and appropriate countermeasures. Republicans may be loath to join calls for such a wide ranging investigation into Russia s election related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as ridiculous. They may worry about picking an obvious fight with the president elect before he is even inaugurated. Trump has signaled he wants a warmer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised during the campaign. I think it s just another excuse. I don t believe it .?.?. No, I don t believe it at all, Trump said of the CIA charges on Fox News Sunday. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway echoed her boss on CBS s Face the Nation, saying that such allegations from the intelligence community were laughable and ridiculous. Trump also played down the importance of receiving the daily intelligence briefing, a tradition for presidents and presidents elect. He has received the briefings only sporadically since winning the election. A U.S. intelligence official said it is concerning that intelligence on Russia relating to the election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan. The inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Trump denies CIA s assessment that Russia tried to help him win election Play Video CIA officials told senators it is now quite clear that electing Donald Trump was Russia s goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. , President elect Trump denied the CIA s assessment. Victoria Walker The Washington Post Trump denies CIA report that Russia intervened to help him win election McConnell himself has been notably silent since the Post report was published on Friday night, and his number two, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn R Texas , downplayed the significance of it in a series of tweets although some of them suggested Congress s review of Russian actions should broaden. All this news of Russian hacking it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news, Cornyn tweeted Saturday. The Texas Republican seemed to support, however, a wider look at Russia as a global actor rather than one confined to its role in the U.S. election, retweeting the below tweet from Graham Cyber attacks, undermining NATO, Ukraine, butchery in Syria, etc. I intend to look at all things Russia not just election influence. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan R Wis. , in his first substantial comment on Russian hacking since the report Friday, said Sunday he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters, calling foreign intervention unacceptable. For the most part, other key Republicans were silent on the issue of whether to embrace a bipartisan look at whether Putin s government was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee emails and their publication by WikiLeaks in an alleged bid to help Trump and damage Hillary Clinton s campaign. At the same time, several Republican senators raised concerns about Trump s likely nomination of Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil s chief executive, as secretary of state due to his ties to Putin. Republicans in a to Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed, should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination. Only three Republicans would need to side with Democrats in order to defeat Tillerson. The potential nomination sparked a backlash among the party s traditional hawks who oppose Putin, and some senior strategists feared that more than a handful of Republicans would outright oppose his nomination requiring Trump to find Democratic support in order to confirm his potential Secretary of State. It s a matter of concern to me that he has such a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, that that would color his approach to Vladimir Putin and the Russian threat, McCain told CBS s Face the Nation. Being a friend of Vladimir is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State, Sen. Marco Rubio R Fla. tweeted Sunday. Republicans outnumber Democrats by only one vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must approve a secretary of state nominee before the full Senate votes. Over the weekend, several committee Democrats, including Sens. Robert Menendez N.J. and Christopher A. Coons Del. , stated their deep skepticism of Tillerson as a candidate. In a post on Facebook, Menendez called the idea Tillerson could be named secretary of state alarming and absurd, concluding that the Trump administration would be guaranteeing Russia has a willing accomplice in the President s Cabinet guiding our nation s foreign policy. Yet the committee s chairman, Sen. Bob Corker R Tenn. who was considered a possible pick for Trump s secretary of state has said Tillerson would be a good choice. If it is Rex Tillerson, he is a very good individual, Corker tweeted. Should Tillerson make it to a floor vote, Democrats could not block the nomination alone. If Democrats stick together, Republicans must muster at least of the votes they will have to successfully confirm him, as Vice President elect Mike Pence could cast the tiebreaking vote. Graham has already also strongly hinted that he might oppose the nomination. I don t know the man much at all, but let s put it this way If you received an award from the Kremlin, order of friendship, then we re gonna have some talkin , Graham said early Saturday morning. We ll have some questions. I don t want to prejudge the guy but that s a bit unnerving. ",

        "text": "President elect Donald Trump said Sunday that nobody really knows whether climate change is real and that he is studying whether the United States should withdraw from the global warming agreement struck in Paris a year ago. In an interview with Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, Trump said he s very open minded on whether climate change is underway but has serious concerns about how President Obama s efforts to cut carbon emissions have undercut America s global competitiveness. I m still open minded. Nobody really knows, Trump said. Look, I m somebody that gets it, and nobody really knows. It s not something that s so hard and fast. I do know this Other countries are eating our lunch. There is a broad scientific consensus that human activity including the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating and industrial manufacturing is driving recent climate change. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that it is extremely likely that, since the s, humans and their greenhouse gas emissions have been the dominant cause of the planet s warming trend. The top hottest years on record have all been since , and is expected to be the hottest year since formal record keeping began in . But it s not the first time that Trump has disregarded that established scientific view. During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to climate change as a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, a comment he later described as a joke. But during a town hall in New Hampshire, he also mocked the idea of global warming. At that event, Meghan Andrade, a volunteer for the League of Conservation Voters, asked Trump what he would do to address the issue, to which he replied Let me ask you this take it easy, fellas how many people here believe in global warming? Do you believe in global warming? After asking three times Who believes in global warming? and soliciting a show of hands, Trump concluded that nobody believed climate change was underway except for Andrade. During Sunday s interview with Wallace, Trump said he needed to balance any environmental regulation against the fact that manufacturers and other businesses in China and elsewhere are able to operate without the kind of restrictions faced by their U.S. competitors. If you look at what I could name country after country. You look at what s happening in Mexico, where our people are just plants are being built, and they don t wait years to get an approval to build a plant, okay? he said. They build it like the following day or the following week. We can t let all of these permits that take forever to get stop our jobs. The U.S. has outpaced the rest of the developed world in terms of growth since the recession, though developing countries such as China boast higher growth rates. Typically, economists compare the U.S. against other industrialized nations since developing countries typically grow faster than their developed counterparts. The New York businessman made the same critique of the Environmental Protection Agency, to which he has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt a climate change skeptic as the head. Wallace asked whether he was going to take a wrecking ball to the Obama legacy, to which Trump replied, No. No. No. I don t want to do that at all. I just want what s right. EPA, you can t get things approved. I mean, people are waiting in line for years before they get rejected, okay? he said. That s why people don t want to invest in this country. It is unclear which permit application Trump was referring to, but he has repeatedly criticized EPA rules. And though he has given mixed signals on whether he would back out of the United States voluntary commitments under the Paris climate agreement, it would take several years for the next administration to withdraw now that the agreement has entered into force. Last week Trump s transition team for the Energy Department asked officials there to identify which employees have participated in international climate negotiations or worked on domestic efforts to cut greenhouse gases, such as calculating the social cost of carbon. Several scientists, federal union officials and public watchdog groups have expressed concern that these individuals could be targeted for retaliation once Trump takes office.

        "text": "The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates this week for the first time this year, but the course of future hikes has suddenly become cloudier. The Fed has signaled for many weeks that it plans to hoist its key rate by a quarter percentage point at a two day meeting that begins Tuesday, and futures markets say there s a chance it will follow through. Meanwhile, President elect Donald Trump s fiscal stimulus proposals may ultimately require faster rate increases to head off inflation, while other byproducts of his plan could slow the economy and prompt the Fed to act more cautiously. For now, economists don t expect Fed policymakers to weigh such hypotheticals as they draft their quarterly projections for rate increases over the next few years. Even so, with unemployment falling rapidly and inflation finally picking up, Fed officials likely are no longer inclined to call for slower rate hikes over the long term, as they have in each of their previous forecasts this year amid headwinds such as weak productivity growth, economists say. Unemployment is falling toward levels that are arguably below stable inflation, says Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economics professor and author of the Fedwatch blog. Yet he says the Fed will almost certainly reiterate that rate increases will be gradual. In November, the jobless rate dropped to . from . the previous month. That s already below the . that the Fed has deemed the lowest average rate sustainable without generating excessive inflation, or rapid price increases that decrease consumers purchasing power and especially hurt savers and those on fixed incomes. Low unemployment typically pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer available workers, and price increases typically follow as the firms scramble to maintain profit margins. That doesn t mean persistently low inflation is poised to suddenly spike.While an inflation measure closely monitored by the Fed rose from . to . annually in October as the effects of low gasoline prices faded, that s well below the Fed s target. Still, it was the fastest pace in two years. And annual wage growth hit a seven year high in October and has climbed steadily since early in a further signal that inflation is firming, Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients. In September, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that discouraged workers on the sidelines were streaming back into the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate elevated and providing the economy more room to run without stoking inflation. But the labor force shrank in both October and November, giving the Fed another reason to make a move this week and stick with its previous forecast of two rate hikes next year and three in . If you were to wait any longer, you would risk getting behind the curve, says JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli. The Fed held off on rate increases earlier this year in response to China s slowdown and a sluggish U.S. economy, among other factors. The future roadmap is fuzzier. Trump has proposed a trillion plan to upgrade the nation s infrastructure and sharp tax cuts, a stimulus package that, if passed by Congress, could fuel inflation and force the Fed to lift rates more rapidly. But, It s probably too early for the Fed to incorporate any fiscal policy issues into their forecast, Duy says. It s similarly too soon, he says, to anticipate negative economic fallout from Trump s restrictive trade proposals. On the other hand, the prospect of more federal spending and faster economic growth and inflation under Trump already has strengthened the dollar and pushed up long term interest rates. Those developments tend to crimp the economy by hurting U.S. exports and discouraging consumer and business borrowing. If they were to persist or intensify next year, the Fed may raise rates more gradually than anticipated, especially if the faster growth portended by Trump s plan hasn t yet materialized, Feroli says.",

        "text": "Two years ago, Jonathan Clark was sending his four school age kids to four different schools in Detroit. We were driving miles a week just to and from school, he said. His three oldest all girls, ages to were enrolled at charters, privately run schools funded by the government that promise better educational outcomes. Clark was able to send his kids to schools all over the city because of school choice, the policy that allows kids to get educated outside their home district. But Clark said the conditions at these charter schools were no different from what s typical of a public school in Detroit a lack of resources needed to educate students, high teacher turnover, and low test scores. These are all things they give bad marks to DPS Detroit public schools on, he said, but charters are doing the same. Analysis Trump s cabinet looks increasingly conventional but far from moderate Donald Trump s personnel picks have stayed within the Republican mainstream few are Trump cronies, and some were even opponents of the president elect Read more That s why Clark is alarmed by Donald Trump s nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the US Department of Education. DeVos, a billionaire and conservative activist from the state, has been one of the strongest defenders in Michigan of expanding charter schools and choice. DeVos and her husband, Dick, have long been a force in education policy efforts in Michigan, as well as other sensitive political issues such as the Michigan legislature s decision to pass right to work legislation. The DeVoses have contributed at least m to state lawmakers and Michigan s GOP party including support for a failed m effort to pass a pro school voucher voter referendum in . Public education advocates who oppose DeVos s nomination point to Michigan s education record particularly in Detroit, where nearly half of students attend charters. Since a quarter century ago, charter advocates have pursued an agenda that has included a lift on the cap for how many can open in the state, as well as an expansion of school choice. Along the way, the state s academic performance has dropped, and Detroit has probably felt the biggest impact. Though charter advocates point to studies that suggest student gains have been made at charters, the city s disconnected array of schools has developed into a frenetic status quo. Just this year, the district has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, prompting teachers facing potential payless work days to stage mass protests, and a federal lawsuit is now attempting to assert a constitutional right to literacy an argument couched in the dismal performance scores of Detroit students. What s more, the state s policies and regulation of charters has been so lax, critics routinely refer to the city s educational landscape as the wild west . Indeed, a federal audit this year noted Michigan s charter school law does not include provisions for regulating conflict of interest issues. The state also allows for profit charters to be established, a practice prohibited elsewhere. Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Photograph Mike Segar Reuters Since , Detroit s population has dropped nearly , while its school district s attendance has plummeted nearly a signal of the proliferation of charters and use of choice in the city. The situation in Michigan is such that even charter advocates criticize the state s approach and DeVos s devotion to maintaining it. It doesn t matter that charter schools aren t giving any of the things they promised years ago, said Stephen Henderson, a Detroit native and editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, who, along with his two children, attended charters. She ... and her family funds any effort to block any changes or accountability or standards that would perhaps produce better results for us. But the pick underscored the polarizing views of DeVos. In her home state, Michigan s governor and attorney general echoed Trump s remarks about her qualifications. Dan Quisenberry, president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies, downplayed criticisms of her background, saying her business experience and previous role as the Michigan GOP chairwoman showed she could lead a large organization and handle political issues. Betsy is a person who will put kids before adults, he said. She s going to put students and parents ahead of politics. Michigan indeed has some high performing charter schools, including in Detroit. Many supporters point to a Stanford study that found charter students in the state learned at a faster rate than those in public schools, with two months of gains, or three months in Detroit. Still, the study found that slightly more than half of Detroit charter schools failed to perform significantly better in math and reading than counterparts, some even worse. This summer, charter school advocates including DeVos s group, the Great Lakes Education Project agreed to some additional accountability measures as part of a m investment to overhaul the governance of Detroit public schools. Schools must now be assessed regularly, and new schools accredited. But a provision to create a commission overseeing Detroit schools was stripped from the legislation after intense lobbying by charter advocates and DeVos. What they feared was the accountability, Henderson, , said. DeVos whose father in law founded Amway, a marketing company that previously settled tax fraud accusations for m has long leveraged her wealth to target Republicans who have not boosted her education agenda. After the commission was derailed, DeVos donated . m to state Republican lawmakers over a two month period. Henderson said GOP lawmakers had told him that in the runup to the decision to axe the Detroit commission, DeVos explicitly stated that she wouldn t donate to their campaign efforts if they didn t flip their votes on the issue. Trump s transition team declined to make DeVos available for an interview and did not provide comment for this story. Quisenberry said critics namely, teachers unions who point to DeVos political influence usually are involved very much in the same influence on the other side What the Detroit commission was about was whose political influence was going to win out, he said. The teachers union was very involved. Clark believes the commission would have addressed the distribution and quality of of schools in the city in his neighborhood, there is just one operational school for , kids. If schools in our neighborhood were open, and up to standards, and producing a quality educational experience, then we wouldn t have had to go to four different schools all over the city, Clark said. Clark now sends his three older kids to private school. But he knows that is off the table for many other parents in the city, where of residents live below the poverty line. What about the parents who aren t in that position? ",

        "text": "If Rex Tillerson is nominated as the next secretary of state, it would confirm Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential election. Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign, which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump. But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome, a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow. While the other leading candidates for the job hold largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia, the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in . The Wall Street Journal reported Friends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson. The year old Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals, including a agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state owned Russian oil company, OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in Exxon Mobil s operations overseas. Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the mid s. Sechin, sometimes described as the second most powerful man in Russia, is now under US sanctions. He has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson . The Exxon Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in , following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted. Trump s choice suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it Thomas Wright, Brookings Institution We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions, he said, at a shareholders meeting. In June, two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin, Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit. If the sanctions were lifted, the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillerson s retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value. He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department. It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career. Trump s choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it, said Thomas Wright, who has written extensively on Trump s foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Tillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea. This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe. Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump said To me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well. Lest there be any doubt about which players the president elect had in mind, Trump added He does massive deals in Russia not for himself, but for the company. A culture of intimidation Stacks and burn off from the Exxon Mobil refinery, at dusk in St Bernard Parish, Louisiana. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stacks and burn off from the Exxon Mobil refinery, at dusk in St Bernard Parish, Louisiana. Photograph Gerald Herbert AP In a very real sense, Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state. Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries. It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces. As a state, it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin. Reporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens, it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude, said Steve Coll, who wrote about the company in a book, Private Empire. They have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations, and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too. They make people nervous, they make people afraid, Coll, now a journalism professor at Columbia University, told Texas Monthly. Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil, however. For a start, Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate. On Saturday, leading Democrats were painting him as a Moscow stooge. The New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the president s cabinet. With a slim majority, it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast Tillerson s job in doubt. He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks, led by John McCain. I have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a murderer, but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then it s the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no, the Arizona senator told CNN on Saturday. A US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values would be a disaster for Russia Andrei Kozyrev, former Russian foreign minister McCain s former chief of staff, Mark Salter, was far more blunt on Twitter. Tillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal, Vlad, he wrote. Should be a rough confirmation hearing, and a no vote on the Senate floor. Even if Tillerson were to be confirmed, he would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy. He would face a striking culture clash with the institution, the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy, which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee, retired general James Mattis, who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of Moscow s assertiveness in Europe. Nevertheless, Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center, argued Tillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war. Not just in US Russian relations a Trump Tillerson foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests, rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology. Trenin added It would be hard nosed and no nonsense, not averse to the use of force, but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat. In one word realist. That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin, whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers, run by strongmen like himself. Andrei Kozyrev, a former Russian foreign minister, argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for. The paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values, but that would be a disaster for Russia, said Kozyrev, who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington. Why? Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine or in Syria is actually in American values that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy. The realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts. If you look at this with a cold eye, you say Let them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine, Kozyrev said. Look at Syria. By realpolitik the Americans would rather sit and wait while Russia draws on its resources and gets into bloody conflict. ",

        "text": "Legislators overseeing the CIA and other intelligence agencies have told the Guardian they will be vigilant about reprisals from Donald Trump over an internal assessment that Russia intervened in the election to ensure Trump s victory. Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus. When the president elect s transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community IC , it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts, Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, told the Guardian. Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel, Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference. Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators, mostly but not exclusively Democrats, who consider the Russia hack a national emergency. It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world. Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns. One noted that civil service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge, but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people who have attended climate change policy conferences . Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month. Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus, picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new president s attitudes toward the agencies. There is not just smoke here. There is a alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid Glenn Carle, former CIA officer There is not just smoke here. There is a blazing alarm fire, the sirens are wailing, the Russians provided the lighter fluid, and Trump is standing half burnt and holding a match, said Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer and interrogator. The facts hurt, Trump won t like the truth, and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity. After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election, Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committee s digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump, not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election. In response, Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments. His transition team said in a statement These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Adam Schiff, the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said Trump cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence. If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now, and demean the hard working and patriotic Americans who produced it, I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths, Schiff said. Will he accept the best insights of our agencies, or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions? Trump s clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles. Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus. Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January. Should Trump go through with the reshuffle, it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence, after James Clapper announced his resignation last month. Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director, James Comey, whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump. Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position, between a president of their own party and Russia, a traditional adversary. Devin Nunes, a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee, said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was no surprise . He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of delusions of resetting relations with Russia a policy that Trump is also pursuing. On Sunday, anti Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path, joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking, which they said endangered the country. We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society, the senators said in a joint statement. Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks. Trump reports that Russia influenced US election are ridiculous Also on Sunday, Elijah Cummings, the Maryland Democrat on the investigations heavy House oversight committee, pressured the Republican committee chairman, Jason Chaffetz, and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to join us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nation s interests over the interests of any political party . FBI covered up Russian influence on Trump s election win, Harry Reid claims Read more Carle, the retired CIA officer, said Trump s temperament had played into Russia s hands and put the president elect on a collision course with the CIA. He said Look, in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer, Trump has a reflexive, defensive, monumentally narcissistic personality, for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant, and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself. He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine. He groans with vulnerabilities. He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up, and he is a shockingly easy intelligence target to manipulate. Were Trump an intelligence officer himself, Carle said, he would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United States . A senior intelligence official who was not cleared to talk to reporters supported the push to declassify additional material on the serious matter of the alleged Russian electoral interference, since it happened on our watch .",

Standing on a muddy dirt road in the dead of night near the North Carolina Virginia border, masked Ku Klux Klan members claimed Donald Trump s election as president proves whites are taking back America from blacks, immigrants, Jews and other groups they describe as criminals and freeloaders. America was founded by and for whites, they say, and only whites can run a peaceful, productive society. But still, the KKK members insisted in an interview with The Associated Press, they re not white supremacists, a label that is gaining traction in the country since Trump won with the public backing of the Klan, neo Nazis and other white racists. Related Charleston Church Massacre Survivor Tells of Watching Son Die as Trial Begins We re not white supremacists. We believe in our race, said a man with a Midwestern accent and glasses just hours before a pro Trump Klan parade in a nearby town. He, like three Klan compatriots, wore a robe and pointed hood and wouldn t give his full name, in accordance with Klan rules. Claiming the Klan isn t white supremacist flies in the face of its very nature. The Klan s official rulebook, the Kloran published in and still followed by many groups says the organization shall ever be true in the faithful maintenance of White Supremacy, even capitalizing the term for emphasis. Watchdog groups also consider the Klan a white supremacist organization, and experts say the groups denials are probably linked to efforts to make their racism more palatable. Still, KKK groups today typically renounce the term. The same goes for extremists including members of the self proclaimed alt right, an extreme branch of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism. We are white separatists, just as Yahweh in the Bible told us to be. Separate yourself from other nations. Do not intermix and mongrelize your seed, said one of the Klansmen who spoke along the muddy lane. The Associated Press interviewed the men, who claimed membership in the Loyal White Knights of the KKK, in a nighttime session set up with help of Chris Barker, a KKK leader who confirmed details of the group s Trump victory celebration in advance of the event. As many as cars paraded through the town of Roxboro, North Carolina, some bearing Confederate and KKK flags. Barker didn t participate, though He and a Klan leader from California were arrested hours earlier on charges linked to the stabbing of a third KKK member during a fight, sheriff s officials said.

Reid To Trump Rescind Bannon Appointment Related Trump s Pick of Steve Bannon as Chief Strategist Sparks Backlash The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti Defamation League, which monitor white extremist organizations and are tracking an increase in reports of racist incidents since the election, often use the white supremacist label when describing groups like the Klan white nationalism and white separatism are parts of the ideology. But what exactly is involved? The ADL issued a report last year describing white supremacists as ideologically motivated by a series of racist beliefs, including the notion that whites should be dominant over people of other backgrounds, that whites should live by themselves in a whites only society, and that white people have their own culture and are genetically superior to other cultures. That sounds a lot like some of the ideas espoused by today s white radicals, yet they reject the label. That s likely because they learned the lessons of one time Klan leader David Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana this year, said Penn State University associate professor Josh Inwood. There was this peddling of kinder, softer white supremacy. He tried to pioneer a more respectable vision of the Klan, Inwood said.",

        "text": "With Democrats unable to stop President elect Donald Trump s Cabinet picks on their own, they re hoping that increased scrutiny on his nominees will do it for them. As the minority party in the Senate with little real recourse at their disposal, uncovering something disqualifying may be Democrats last best hope to block some Trump selections that they view as unacceptable and outside the political mainstream. Even if they don t have the votes to shoot down any nominees, Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings. They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves or try to shame them all in the service of trying to peel off the three Republican votes they would need to kill a nomination or force the Trump White House to withdraw the pick. Not all of Trump s picks will face such aggressive scrutiny, which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition. Retired Gen. James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary, even though his recent tenure in the active duty military means he ll need a special waiver that requires votes in the Senate. But some of Trump s picks, Democrats say, represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they ve been tapped to lead, and so the nominees have no business in those jobs. There s Trump s reported pick for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. There s Trump s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, who has made a name for himself by suing the agency. There s Andy Puzder, Trump s choice for the Labor Department, a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots. There s Betsy DeVos, a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education, whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department. And there s attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, an anti immigration hard liner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments. Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks poring over the financial statements, personal histories and public utterances of Trump s most polarizing Cabinet selections, hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees who were forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process. And Democrats have reason to believe Trump s nominees provide an especially rich vein for digging, because according to reports, few have been subjected to a traditionally thorough vetting process by his transition team. Many are wealthy business executives with sprawling financial entanglements and no political experience or the scrutiny that comes with it. What s unusual about Trump s Cabinet picks is that so few of them come from politics, which means that they re going to have a harder time than usual going through the traditional vet and public evaluation, said Simon Rosenberg, president of the Democratic think tank NDN. Some of them are going to crash. Some of them aren t going to make it because of things that are going to come up in their background. Democrats will have to pick their battles, and priorities will likely be decided based not only by how threatening they find Trump s nominees, but how vulnerable the nominees are after some digging. Related Donald Trump Builds Cabinet with Old Friends and Some Rivals Much of it depends on what s uncovered in the vetting process, said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada. As Senator Daschle found out, one little thing can trip you up. Daschle was nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services in but removed his name after controversy over his taxes emerged. Old domestic abuse allegations related to a messy divorce have already surfaced with Puzder. But complicated financial issues are more likely to trip up Trump s nominees than personal indiscretions, especially given the number of super wealthy candidates Trump has chosen. The Senate Finance Committee has developed a reputation as somewhat of a killing field for nominees in recent years, Manley said. They ve developed the experience to really pick apart the financials. And Trump s team may be flying blind to some extent. His transition team has reportedly forgone the rigorous vetting process traditionally performed on potential nominees before they are announced publicly, leaving his picks potentially vulnerable to surprises. Selecting Rep. Mike Pompeo, R kansas, as CIA director was pretty simple, said Rep. Devin Nunes, R California, who is working on Trump s transition team. They asked me who would be the person for the agency, and I said without a doubt that Pompeo would be a great pick, Nunes told Politico. Dan Kanninen, a former Obama White House official who helped choose candidates for jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency, said it takes weeks or months for even the best transition teams to properly vet candidates. With Trump, none of that, as far as we can tell, happened before the election. And now, if it is happening at all, it s happening in a matter of days based on the gut on the president elect, he said. It would not surprise me at all, given how little we know and frankly how little the Trump team knows if something came up with of a magnitude that might kill some of their nominations. Even under the best of circumstances, things get missed. Clinton rescinded Baird s nomination to be attorney general because it was discovered that she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. The Senate confirmation process can be brutal even for squeaky clean candidates who have spent their whole careers in government. A Survivor s Guide for Presidential Nominees prepared by the National Academy of Public Administration, a congressionally chartered non profit, stretches over pages and warns, If you are not nervous going into your confirmation hearing, you should be. Nov. Trump Scrutinized Over Cabinet Picks, Intelligence Briefings It may be especially bumpy for Trump s nominees from the private sector, who are not accustomed to government processes and who have not already gone through the kind of public and legal scrutiny politicians and government officials are used to. Three years ago, facing Republican obstruction, Senate Democrats decided to kill the filibuster for executive branch appointments, which means they now cannot force Republicans to find the votes needed to break a filibuster. Republicans need only votes in the Senate to confirm Trump s Cabinet picks. Democrats would need three Republicans to join them to shoot down any of Trump s nominees, and so far none have expressed interest in taking up the cause. Some Democrats, unsurprisingly, are having buyer s remorse about the filibuster change, including Reid s successor as Democratic Leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. I wanted for Supreme Court and Cabinet, but I didn t prevail, Schumer told The Washington Post. Still, he vowed opposition to some nominees, however possible. If it s somebody who is out of the mainstream, Schumer said, we ll fight tooth and nail and use every tool we have. The Senate has traditionally deferred to new presidents wishes in filling out their Cabinets, approving many nominees without bothering to even take formal votes. Recent incoming presidents have had to withdraw only one or two Cabinet picks, if any at all, and the Senate has voted to outright reject just three nominees in the past years, according to the Senate historian. But Democrats are in no mood to be deferential to Trump after Republicans, in their view, broke with tradition by obstructing Obama Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for nine months and fought the confirmation of his second attorney general, Loretta Lynch. And they say Trump has chosen blatantly provocative or unqualified nominees, instead of trying to find common ground in a divided country. Donald Trump is kind of giving a big middle finger to that entire department by nominating someone who was found to have percent of his restaurants in noncompliance with labor laws, Sen. Chris Murphy, D Connecticut, told MSNBC on Friday of Trump s decision to name Puzder to head the department responsible for protecting workers. ",

        "text": "President elect Donald Trump s dismissal of U.S. intelligence findings that Russia tried to sway the presidential election is a distressing slap in the face to the intelligence community, current and former U.S. intelligence officials said Sunday. Trump on Sunday repeated his rejection of the intelligence community s conclusion that Russia actively worked to help him win the election, calling the idea ridiculous in an interview on Fox News Sunday. The comment, like others that Trump made during the campaign, is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country, a U.S. intelligence official told NBC News. Play There Needs to Be a Sense of Trust Between Trump and Spy Agencies, Ex FBI Official Says Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed There Needs to Be a Sense of Trust Between Trump and Spy Agencies, Ex FBI Official Says The official called it concerning that the president elect has chosen to impugn the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials by disputing professional intelligence judgments as false or politically partisan. A congressional official with knowledge of the issue told NBC News on Saturday that the CIA has concluded that Russia mounted a covert intelligence operation to help Trump win the election. Another source briefed on the intelligence told NBC News that the U.S. government has identified specific Russian actors it believes were involved in computer systems hacks based on intercepted communications, human tips and computer forensics. Donald Trump Dismisses Claims That Russia Interfered in Election Trump dismissed such reports in a statement Friday that derided the CIA as the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. A former senior intelligence official also noted Trump s assertion Sunday on Fox News that he doesn t always take the Presidential Daily Briefing the top secret briefing on national security developments because I m, like, a smart person. It is curious that someone who refuses to take intelligence briefings has decided that he doesn t agree with the analysis contained in them, the former official said. Trump s dispute of CIA troubling Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat the House Intelligence Committee, also blasted Trump, saying the integrity of the electoral process is called into question when President elect Trump and his transition team minimize or dismiss the intelligence assessments themselves. Even more damaging are comments that impugn the tens of thousands of Americans who are at work every day of the year, many in great physical danger, to protect us and to provide our national leadership regardless of political party with the best information possible, Schiff said Saturday. Perhaps, once he has taken office, Mr. Trump will go to the CIA and look at the rows of memorial stars in the lobby each representing a fallen officer and reflect on his disparagement of the intelligence community s work, he said.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON The FBI warrant that shook Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in its final two weeks has been unsealed, and the lawyer who requested it says it offers nothing at all to merit the agency s actions leading up to the Nov. election. The warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy Schoenberg, who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner s computer might be incriminating to Clinton. Weiner is the estranged husband of Clinton s top aide, Huma Abedin. Under the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documented. The letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected non content header information suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its already completed investigation of Clinton s private email server. The FBI request concludes there is probable cause to believe that the laptop contained evidence, contraband, fruits and or items illegally possessed, without providing specifics. I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Clinton and Abedin, Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY. It remains unknown why they thought they might find evidence of a crime, why they felt it necessary to inform Congress, and why they even sought this search warrant, he said. I am appalled. The FBI s Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Clinton campaign officials echoed Schoenberg s complaints Tuesday. Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the unsealed filings regarding Huma s emails reveals Comey s intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time. Read more New emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probe FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton s email The FBI concluded in July that there was no clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws and that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. Then, two weeks before the election, Comey sent a three paragraph letter to Congress that said in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that appear to be pertinent to Clinton s private email server. Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was significant. The letter was so vague that Clinton s opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump, including his past treatment of women. Trump called it bigger than Watergate and predicted that the FBI would right the ship after previously deciding against criminal charges. Comey s investigation was the primary cudgel for Trump and his supporters, who claimed falsely that Clinton was guilty of criminal activity. His large rallies regularly chanted Lock her up! and Clinton s motorcade was greeted in city after city with angry crowds waving signs. Hillary Clinton walks off the stage after speaking Hillary Clinton walks off the stage after speaking about her election defeat in New York on Nov. , . Photo Matt Rourke, AP Abedin s lawyers have also been requesting permission to review the warrant, which they say their client never saw and hadn t or even been alerted to, preventing them from responding publicly in the final days of the campaign. Two days before the election, Comey confirmed there was no new information. At the same time, Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., accused him of holding back explosive information about Russian interference. The retiring senator said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits activity directed towards the success or failure of a candidate. On Monday, former president Bill Clinton said his wife fought through everything, and she prevailed against it all. But she couldn t endure the combination of the FBI s interference and Russian meddling. At the end, we had the Russians and the FBI deal. But she couldn t prevail against that, Clinton told reporters in Albany. Read more Bill Clinton Hillary couldn t prevail over Russians, FBI Trump wins Electoral College vote as insurgency fizzles Newly certified Trump feuds with Bill Clinton Republicans have mocked the Clintons contention and said it s an excuse for some of the strategic mistakes the campaign made. Yet the election was decided by the smallest of margins in a handful of Rust Belt states. Nate Silver, a leading elections statistician and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight, says Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race and that she would almost certainly be president elect if the election had been held the day before the letter. He cited late deciding voters breaking strongly against her enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Schoenberg said more information needs to be made public before the matter is put to rest. The FBI agent s name has not been disclosed, but I think that it may be appropriate to find out his her name and determine what the motivations were, since it must have been obvious to the FBI that there was no real probable cause to believe they would find evidence of a crime, he said in a follow up email. It was very wrong for Director Comey to give that impression. Schoenberg is a lawyer who gained notoriety by reclaiming Jewish owned art seized by the Nazis and former president of the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON President elect Donald Trump campaigned on a vow to repeal what he claims are job killing federal regulations, including rules limiting power plant emissions, protecting rivers and streams, and preventing banks from reckless lending. Easier said than done. The same deliberate process used to enact the Clean Power Plant rule, the waters of the U.S. Clean Water Rule, or regulations under the Dodd Frank law designed to clamp down on Wall Street usually requires the same long slog to undo them, making quick repeal unattainable. In general, rule changes originate from the agencies who must offer a legal, scientific or other legitimate reason in defense of the proposed change, and solicit public comments first before a new rule or its repeal can take effect. In most cases, the final rule may not become effective until at least days after its publication in the Federal Register. The process is laborious, but that shouldn t stop every agency head from setting it in motion, Andy Koenig, vice president of policy at the Koch affiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a recent column on the group s website. The very fact that it is so time consuming makes it essential for agencies to start the process immediately. Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations Small businesses can expect policy changes under Trump But a Republican president and a compliant Congress controlled by Republicans can still do quite a bit in short order to block a host of proposed regulations or reverse rules that were recently implemented. Overall, critics say regulations pose a trillion drag on to the U.S. economy every year, according to some estimates, though agencies also design rules to maximize economic benefits. Stakeholders have been weighing in about the rules they d like to see tossed. Among them is the House Freedom Caucus, the hard right faction of House lawmakers who have clashed with congressional leaders in recent years. The group Wednesday asked the incoming Trump administration to jettison rules its members view as burdensome, costly or unworkable, including ones setting nutrition standards for school lunches, requiring certain animal and plant inspections, and development of alternative fuels. Despite some steep hurdles, here s what Trump and Congress can do Incoming presidents can prevent regulations that have yet to be finalized from ever taking effect. It s standard practice for a new administration to freeze any regulations that are in the pipeline until the incoming regime can review them, said Jerry Ellig, senior research fellow at George Mason University s Mercatus Center. President Obama did just than when he came into office in , as did his predecessors. If it s something that the current administration has finished and sent to the Federal Register but it isn t published before Inauguration Day, then it s easy for a new administration to pull those rules back, he said. Many could still go forward after the review is complete and the Trump administration supports them. Congress also has a limited window where it can undo rules with a simple majority vote that cannot be filibustered. Such resolutions of disapproval must be passed and signed within legislative days from their publication in the federal register and their insertion into the Congressional Record. Under the Congressional Review Act, agencies must report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provide lawmakers a legislative roadmap to overturn those rules if they oppose them, according to the Congressional Research Service. The Mercatus Center lists Obama administration rules adopted since June that could be subject to the review act. They include rules on implementing school wellness policies, regulating municipal solid waste landfills and food labeling guidelines. But the incoming Congress will have to be picky because the law requires that rule reversals can only be done one at a time. With all the other priorities facing them such as working on a budget and considering Trump s nominees, there s may not be much floor time for wholesale regulatory rollback, Ellig said. That hurdle helps explain why the Congressional Review Act has been used only once since it became law years ago. In , Congress and the George W. Bush administration overturned a Clinton administration rule setting an ergonomics standard for the workplace. Agencies can decide not to enforce certain regulations because they re focused on other priorities. Or the Trump administration could choose to stop defending rules if they are the subject of a court challenge. That passive approach is a pretty easy way to undermine laws that are already around and public protections that already exist, said Lisa Gilbert, director of Public Citizen s Congress Watch, a government watchdog group. Deciding not to defend the regulation in court wouldn t guarantee the rule s demise. Affected third parties would likely still be arguing for its enforcement and judges could still rule on the legality of the provision. But it could leave open questions that we would obviously rather have answered about our regulatory state, Gilbert said. Lawmakers could pass a law undoing the rule. The cleanest and in many ways steepest path to eliminating a rule is to have Congress approve legislation doing just that. That s what it will probably take to gut some of the Obama administration s most high profile regulations, such as ones associated with clean water, clean power, overtime protections, the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform. Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Nov. , . Photo Paul Sancya, AP Within that category, there are several approaches using spending bills to insert language known as riders preventing an agency from allocating funds to enforce a regulation, using a process known as reconciliation to fast track bills to undo rules, and passing bills through the regular legislative process. That last option is least desirable for regulatory reformers because it could take years, and it gives Democrats the chance to stop a rule rollback through filibuster. None of this includes the executive orders that President Trump could undo with a stroke of his pen, namely President Obama s deportation protections for millions of undocumented immigrants who arrived here as young children. Trump has already unveiled his plan to tackle regulation reform Ask all department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs, and which does not improve public safety, and eliminate them. Gilbert, with Public Citizen, said it s hard to predict how many of the Obama era rules will survive. Our success in preserving any of them is going to depend on our ability to make it very clear to the American public ... what it means to take away these things that are so populist, so important, she said. Nobody wants to lose pay raises they ve already achieved or protections of their health and their air. ",

        "text": "WASHINGTON The very first President s Intelligence Checklist the predecessor to what s now known as the President s Daily Briefing was delivered to President John F. Kennedy on a June Saturday in . Typewritten on eight pages of . by inch paper and stamped For the President Only Top Secret, it contained two sentence briefs culled from diplomatic, military, intelligence and press sources, six shorter notes, and maps of Laos and the Congo. Today, President Obama receives the document on an iPad. The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions. The maps can be interactive, and the briefings can include video. The differences aren t just technological. After serving presidents and now preparing to brief the th, President elect Donald Trump the President s Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decision making styles of each commander in chief. And the ways in which it s produced, read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach national security issues. It s the only standing meeting he has every day. Even if we don t have the meeting, he gets the document, said Obama s deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes. Everyday there s the possibility that he ll see something that will cause him to move the entire U.S. government in a new direction. There s nothing else like that. For Obama, the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president who s often disdainful of raw, unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective. He encourages dissenting opinions. He s interested in open source intelligence including press accounts and, increasingly, social media in addition to old fashioned spycraft and intercepted communications. President elect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence. He s still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for, and catered to, Obama. He s reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president, part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry Truman. But Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence. For the first month, he received in person intelligence briefings only once a week, although his transition team now says it s three times a week. But Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrant. I get it when I need it, Trump told Fox News Sunday. I don t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years, he said. I don t need that. But I do say, If something should change, let us know. In skipping daily briefings, Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agencies Aides Trump gets frequent classified briefings Obama has said much the same about his daily briefing albeit much later in his presidency. Over the years, you accumulate knowledge, Obama said in a YouTube interview earlier this year. Now, I ve got enough of a baseline of knowledge. I ve seen problems come up before, I ve seen patterns that have emerged. I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did. ... I m skimming. I m looking at, are there significant differences? The frequency, the duration, the format, the depth, the subject matter even the distribution list are all up to the president. In a book published earlier this year, former CIA officer David Priess argued that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it and will continue to evolve to meet the president s personality, learning style and priorities. If a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance, he or she will get that, said Priess, author of The President s Book of Secrets The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings. There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessons. The President s Daily Briefing is what its name implies, Priess said. It is brief. Everything is not going to make it in. It s daily. If it s not breaking, or not current, it doesn t get in, he said. But the most important word is president. Is this deserving of his attention? That s a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess. And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues and for the intelligence community to get to know the president elect. Current and former national security officials say frequent, in person briefings with the president and the president elect are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is well informed. There is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants, former CIA director Michael Hayden said. In his book, Playing to the Edge American Intelligence in the Age of Terror, he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the aw, s moment. Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four star general, Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four star general, former director of the National Security Agency and former director of the CIA. Photo Jasper Colt, USA TODAY It s attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the president elect s political advisers with a dose of reality. Hayden calls it phenomenon of the unpleasant fact. That s when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration. You re telling them something they don t want to hear and don t want to believe, he said. And it s important to do that in an in person briefing, as opposed to the written product. You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker, Hayden said. And you need the ability to do that face to face, and to do it with your tone, and your words and your body language to communicate, as opposed to just throwing it over the transom. When Obama first took office, the intelligence community grumbled that Obama or at least his national security staff wanted the reports so brief that they called them PDB haiku. Hayden s early briefings of Obama he was replaced three weeks into Obama s presidency were far less tactical than the briefings President George W. Bush was receiving. But Michael Leiter, who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama, said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early months. His inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy, and more about how the U.S. was perceived in the world and interacted in the world, he said. But there certainly was an evolution. To me, that was most crystallized, around the time of underwear bomber, he said, referring to the Christmas Day plot to bring down a Detroit bound airliner. That so changed the president s perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these things. From then on, he said, any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address it. Still, it s a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team. Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the uncorroborated bits of information or to attribute more credibility to information only because it s classified. Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that you re not looking at what s right in front of your eyes, Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the election. It s worrisome to get into raw intelligence, he said. Because you may have some intercept that you think is great, but it could be some official in some country, it could be just their view, or what they hope happens. Or, sometimes they know that the National Security Agency is listening, and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence. That s where the job of ODNI is very hard. Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Ben Rhodes Photo Mandel Ngan, AFP Getty Images ODNI is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, an office created by Congress in in a series of post intelligence reforms. While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community, the CIA by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis still has an outsized role in the process. Obama has said he s conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts. I ve learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I do about a topic, Obama said in the YouTube interview. And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same time. But while Obama says he listens to all voices, not all of those voices feel that they re being heard. A report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government and found that broader community participation in the President s Daily Brief PDB remains a challenge. Rhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lower level analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter s presidency. Let s get the analysts who are living through these issues every day, Rhodes said. He likes that, so he s tried to do that more. The daily book often contains dissenting views, which Leiter said were often the most illuminating thing in a PDB article. And under Obama, non urgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president. And highly sensitive information gleaned from top secret sources and methods is balanced with open source intelligence the kind of information that s available to anyone reading a newspaper. Rebalancing the PDB Presidents, of course, also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities and that gets reflected in their briefings. Richard Nixon s had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China. Ronald Reagan s was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union. And for the last two presidents, the Middle East has dominated the PDB to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider aperture. You could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia, Rhodes said. To the point where we ve had to say, Hey, guys, we re rebalancing to the Asia Pacific. Make sure that s represented in the PDB. You almost have to reach out for that stuff, because it doesn t always naturally come up. Obama s PDB also increasingly includes information on economic, environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security. And they re not necessarily confined to foreign affairs. Last summer, deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefing. This Aug. , , file photo shows a man crossing This Aug. , , file photo shows a man crossing the CIA logo in the lobby of CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. Photo Saul Loeb, AFP Getty Images World s most exclusive newspaper The President s Daily Briefing, also known as the book, is among the most secret documents the government keeps. For a time, even its very existence was thought to be classified. It s just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community. But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief, it has a sense of urgency and importance and even mystique that other top secret documents don t have. Today it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it, said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified , briefings to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson last year. The PDB is the most abundantly staffed, most deeply sourced daily information service in the world. It s been referred to as the world s most exclusive daily newspaper, written exclusively for the president of the United States. But presidents can and do share the PDB with a small circle of advisers. Kennedy never shared his with his vice president. Nixon deeply distrusted the CIA and often ignored the briefing, instead delegating it to national security adviser Henry Kissinger. The younger Bush restricted the distribution to just six or seven people. In the Obama administration, the distribution list is thought to be as many as two dozen, including the secretary of State. In her book Hard Choices, Clinton called the hand delivered report the first order of business after getting to the office each morning. Her schedules, released under the Freedom of Information Act, often allotted the first five minutes of every morning to reading the PDB. The president could even share the briefing with members of his family. Trump and his family have denied reports that he s sought security clearances for his children and for son in law Jared Kushner, but the president is the ultimate authority on how classified information can be shared and with whom. Trump has also raised eyebrows by appearing to question the CIA s integrity in the wake of reports that the spy agency had concluded that Russia deliberately interfered in the election to get Trump elected. These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, the Trump transition said in a statement to reporters last week. That prompted the White House to defend the intelligence officers and suggest that Trump would do well to listen to them. President Obama s experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. President Obama is certainly not the first president to have enjoyed the benefits of the experts in our intelligence community, and I m confident the president elect would benefit from that advice if he remains open to it.

        "text": "WASHINGTON Donald Trump will officially become president next month. Trump surpassed the electoral votes needed from electors casting their ballots, in a day of normally ceremonial voting that drew attention amid intense social media pressure and protests in state capitols. Despite a last minute push by outside progressive and Libertarian groups, there was no rebellion. In fact, most of the faithless electors appeared to be Hillary Clinton defectors in Washington state, with three voting for former secretary of State Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American an environmental activist. Two Texas GOP electors went rogue and didn t vote for Trump. The meetings, which occur more than a month after the Nov. election, are typically a formality. This year, Trump critics mounted a vocal campaign appealing to the Republican electors pledged to vote for him. The official results of the vote will be announced before Congress on Jan. , although the results from each state were released throughout the day Monday. Is this any way to choose a president? Only half of Americans think so GOP electors targeted with K ad buy in final anti Trump push Aides Critics trying to use Electoral College to de legitimize Trump Electors received thousands of emails and phone calls arguing Trump is unqualified, as the first president in the nation s history with no military or government experience and with potential conflicts of interest due to his business empire. Confirmation by the FBI and CIA that the Russian government hacked Clinton s campaign and the Democratic National Committee seeking to help Trump win the election have amplified their calls. Frankly, at this point, I m wondering if Putin helped Trump win the Republican primary, Chris Suprun, a Texas elector who s been an outspoken critic, said before the voting began. In Rhode Island, electors passed a motion calling for an independent, bipartisan investigation into Russian intervention in the election as Congress debates whether the matter should be reviewed by Republican led committees or as an independent probe. Thousands of protesters gathered outside state capitals throughout the country. Yet in the end, the rebellion fell far short of the dozens of potential faithless electors that some Trump opponents said could materialize. Opponents would have needed GOP electors to switch their votes. The one alternative to Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, had told electors not to vote for him. Even if there were a mass defection, the matter would have kicked to the Republican led House of Representatives, which was unlikely to override their own party s president. Further, the Republican National Committee conducted a parallel whip effort to make sure electors stick to the plan to vote for Trump. Clinton won more than . million more votes than Trump nationwide. But Trump won a majority of the electoral votes the state by state system created by the nation s founders based on the size of a state s congressional delegation. A short history lesson on presidents winning without the popular vote It s the second time in recent history, including Democrat Al Gore s loss in to George W. Bush, that the person winning the popular vote lost the election. Before that, it hadn t been since , when Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland, that a candidate won the presidency despite losing the popular vote. The trend is causing Democrats to question the system by which the nation chooses its leaders, according to a new USA TODAY Suffolk University Poll. It finds of registered voters believe the Electoral College should choose the president. Yet more than four in say the Constitution should be amended so the popular vote prevails in choosing the commander in chief. Liberals are most likely to want a change while conservatives want to keep the current system. Trump assumes the mantle with an electorate deeply skeptical of his presidency, according to a new Wall Street Journal NBC News poll. While the percentage of voters who view him positively has increased to , that s points less than those who view him unfavorably. While said they were optimistic and satisfied about Trump as president, it s points below Obama s number in January and points below George W. Bush s number at the same time in .",

        "text": "WASHINGTON President Obama says he has no regrets about his go it alone use of executive power even if President elect Donald Trump can now use those same powers to roll back his policies. I think that he is entirely within his lawful power to do so, Obama said in an interview with National Public Radio broadcast Monday. If he wants to reverse some of those rules, that s part of the democratic process. In his traditional end of year public radio interview, Obama offered a wide ranging defense of his use of presidential power as he prepares to turn the levers of that power over to man he once described as unfit for the presidency. Obama argued that his use of executive action wasn t much different from his predecessors. What changed, he said, is that Congress became less willing to pass legislation. Congress has become so dysfunctional that more and more of a burden is placed on the agencies to fill in the gaps, and the gaps get bigger and bigger because they re not constantly refreshed and tweaked, he said. And the bottom line is, if you want to right size executive power relative to the other branches of government, the best way to do that is to have a healthy Congress in which the two parties are debating, disagreeing but also occasionally working together to pass legislation. The same thing has happened on foreign policy, he said. The Obama administration has been relying a post congressional war authorization intended for al Qaeda in order to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The danger is that over time, Congress starts feeling pretty comfortable with just having the president do all this stuff and not really having to weigh in, he said. The president and the executive branch are always going to have greater latitude and greater authority when it comes to protecting America, because sometimes you just have to respond quickly and not everything that is a danger can be publicized and be subject to open debate. But Obama also said he s installed guardrails on the president s war powers, setting up systems of internal accountability on issues like drone strikes and electronic surveillance by the National Security Agency. You know, there are some critics on the left who would argue we haven t gone far enough on that. I would argue that we ve gotten it about right, although I m the first one to admit that we didn t get it all right on day one, he said.",

Whether it is his distinguished military service or highly impressive track record in the world of business, Vinnie has proved throughout his life that he knows how to be a leader and deliver major results in the face of any challenge, Trump said in a statement. Trump has pledged to increase the size of the nation s armed forces. Viola, founder and chairman of Virtu Financial and owner of pro hockey s Florida Panthers, said in a statement that, if confirmed by the Senate, I will work tirelessly to provide our President with the land force he will need to accomplish any mission in support of his National Defense Strategy.

As secretary of the Army, Viola would work with retired general James Mattis, whom Trump has nominated to be secretary of Defense.

A new NBC News Wall Street Journal poll finds percent of adults saying that they are either uncertain percent or pessimistic and worried percent about how Trump will perform during his presidency, compared with percent with either an optimistic and confident view percent or a satisfied and hopeful view percent . That s a significantly worse outlook than Americans expressed after the elections of both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. A combined percent were either optimistic or hopeful about Obama in January , according to the same poll, while percent were optimistic or hopeful about George W. Bush in January . The data show the extent to which the nation remains unusually divided even though Election Day is in the rearview mirror, said Democratic pollster Fred Yang of Hart Research Associates, which conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his firm Public Opinion Strategies. Usually elections settle arguments and the nation comes together, at least in the short term, Yang said. Today, hard feelings persist on both sides of the partisan divide. It s as if the campaign has never ended. Those partisan differences are particularly stark when it comes to public approval ratings of the way Trump is handling his transition. Half of the country overall gives Trump high marks so far, compared to percent who give him a thumbs down. But among Hillary Clinton s voters, only percent approve of how he s handling the transition, compared to percent of Trump voters. Back in , percent of John McCain s voters approved of Barack Obama s handling of his presidential transition, and in , percent of George H.W. Bush s voters backed Bill Clinton s early moves as president elect. The partisan divide extends to views about the men and women Trump has selected to lead his administration. Seventy eight percent of Democrats say they are disappointed with the administration appointments Trump has made so far, while percent of Republicans say they are generally pleased with Trump s picks. While Trump s overall favorability has ticked up modestly since before the election, he remains underwater, with more Americans giving him a poor rating percent than a positive one percent. That marks the first time that an incoming president has been viewed more negatively than positively in the history of the NBC WSJ poll. Some bright spots but ones mostly driven by enthusiasm from Trump s supporters While the public is largely apprehensive about the president elect, Americans do say that they are more optimistic that the U.S. economy will improve in the next year. Forty two percent say they believe the economy will get better the highest share since autumn of while only percent say the economy will get worse in the next year. Trump has also generated relatively positive feelings about his ability to change the federal government for the better. A majority of Americans say Trump will shake up the way government operates and, among that group, they believe that he ll bring the right kind of change by a two to one margin percent to percent . Additionally, a majority fifty six percent say they are optimistic that Trump will keep U.S. jobs from going overseas. Still, the confidence about Trump s presidency is mostly fueled by enthusiasm among his base voters rather than by more hopeful expectations among those who didn t choose him on their ballot in November. A whopping percent of Trump voters are optimistic about his ability to bring change to Washington, while just percent of Clinton voters say the same. The same share of Trump voters percent say they are hopeful that Trump will look out for those who are struggling in today s economy, while only nine percent of Clinton voters agree. Those who say that the economy will get better in the next year rather than worse include key Trump constituency groups like whites percent better compared to percent worse , Republicans percent better to six percent worse , and men percent better to percent worse. Among Democrats, percent believe the economy will get worse compared to percent who believe it will improve, and just percent of African Americans think the economy will improve compared to a third who say it will deteriorate. The public also still harbors concerns about Trump s temperament. Just percent of Americans say they are optimistic that Trump has the right temperament to be president, while percent say they are worried about the issue. The Republican Party gets a boost but will it last? In the wake of the election, the Republican Party now has a higher net favorability rating percent positive, percent negative than the Democratic Party percent positive, percent negative . That s the first time since after the midterms that Republicans have scored better on the favorability measure than their Democratic counterparts.

So we re going to be there for the next president and do whatever we have to do to make sure that he is successful, because if he succeeds, we all succeed, Obama told Winfrey during her final one on one White House interview, which aired Monday at p.m. ET on CBS. In the one hour program, Obama reflected on her eight years as first lady, discussing topics including her surprise at being called an angry black woman during her husband s presidential campaign and Trump s comments about women. For all the people out there, they have to understand that, as I ve said time and time again, words matter, she said. And they matter most to our kids, our young people.

Keith Ellison. The Democratic leadership contest has taken on unusual significance in the wake of Hillary Clinton s devastating loss last month, dividing the labor movement between two Democrats whom it has long seen as allies. The AFL CIO, a federation of unions that includes the IAFF, endorsed Ellison just before Perez entered the race last week, despite protests from IAFF President Harold Schaitberger and others. In a statement, Schaitberger praised Perez as a a tireless advocate for civil and human rights who can transcend what the union president called a narrow focus on identity and cultural politics that alienated some longtime Democrats from the party. Tom Perez is the person who has the right mix of personal background, progressive values, experience and total commitment to all workers, in all regions and states across the country, Schaitberger said. To have Tom Perez as the Chair of one of our nation s two major political parties would be a significant victory for workers across America. Perez, the son of Dominican immigrants, has been leaning on his heritage to appeal to Latino DNC members. But Schaitberger, whose union is on the conservative end of the spectrum, said the Labor Secretary is the best person to reorient the party around a strong economic message that is truly inclusive of everyone. Ellison, an African American convert to Islam who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary, has faced questions over past associations with Nation of Islam founder Louis Farrakhan, whom he long ago disowned. Schaitberger earlier spoke out against the AFL CIO s endorsement process, which gave its executive committee members only three options Vote to endorse Ellison, abstain, or make no endorsement. That vote was an attempt to present a united front from the labor movement, which is well represented among the voting members of the DNC, and to avoid a damaging intraparty squabble. But the IAFF is the second major union in the AFL CIO to back Perez, and more defections may come. On Friday, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union one of the country s largest unions, with . million members came out in support of the labor secretary, saying its members saw firsthand his passion and commitment to their issues during his work heading the Department of Labor. Another union, the United Farm Workers, endorsed Perez on Monday. Their membership is small, but the endorsement comes with a symbolic connection to famed labor leader Cesar Chavez, who founded the union. He has been a lifelong friend of labor and immigrants. When farm workers needed him, Tom Perez stood up and fought, said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez, noting it was the first time the union has ever endorsed in a DNC chair race. He played a key role in helping farm workers in California win the same overtime pay protections as all other workers, and in doing so is helping end years of race based discrimination.

        "text": "The battle over President elect Donald Trump s attorney general nominee, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, is heating up ahead of what promises to be a deeply contested confirmation hearing next year. Groups on the left are ratcheting up their criticism of Sessions on issues such as immigration, criminal justice and voting rights while those supporting him are unveiling the first component of what is expected to be a vigorous campaign in his favor. His confirmation hearings are scheduled for January and before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Play Racism concerns surround Sessions as AG pick Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Racism concerns surround Sessions as AG pick The conservative Judicial Crisis Network on Thursday launched a website, ConfirmSessions, accompanied by a six figure ad buy touting the Alabama senator as someone who will enforce the law. The digital ads, targeting the Washington, D.C. market, show clips of Trump praising Sessions and highlighting his experience as U.S. attorney in Alabama and then senator of the southern state. From his time as U.S. Attorney to his tenure as attorney general for the state of Alabama, Jeff Sessions successfully prosecuted drug and violent criminals, corrupt politicians and white collar offenders and his record shows an absolute commitment to equal justice under law by putting the people first not powerful special interests, said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network. Related Trump Taps Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for Attorney General Post Now the battle lines are being drawn over his nomination. Sessions has a controversial past on issues of race and immigration, including his failed confirmation of a federal judgeship years ago largely because of racially insensitive remarks. In the s, Sessions was considered for a Ronald Reagan appointed federal district judgeship in Alabama, but was blocked by the Senate after a black former deputy, Thomas Figures, accused him of making racially insensitive statements. Figures said that Sessions called him boy and had once warned him to be careful about what he said to white folks. Sessions denied the remarks under oath at the time. In addition, U.S. Attorney E.T. Rolison and Assistant U.S. Attorney Ginny Grenade two people Figures said were in the room at the time of the alleged remarks signed affidavits saying they did not hear Sessions call Figures boy. Grenade signed the affidavit in and Rolison signed one on December of . Figures, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Alabama, also testified that, during a murder investigation tied to the Ku Klux Klan, Sessions commented that he used to think they the KKK were OK until he found out some were pot smokers. Sessions claimed he had been joking. Now, progressives are pouncing. The progressive group People for the American Way has drawn attention to missing information that Sessions failed to include in a vast questionnaire that he is required to fill out ahead of his confirmation hearings. In a page memo that outlines Sessions omissions, PFAW notes that in response to questions about his public statements, Sessions listed opinion articles that he wrote. But the group found more. He also didn t include any of the press releases from and , including one on the Federal Marriage Amendment, according to the group. Nor did Sessions make mention of his failed nomination to be a federal judge from years ago. NBC Reports On Jeff Sessions Confirmation Hearing Sessions questionnaire is grossly incomplete we ve found hundreds of relevant missing documents in just a few days, said Marge Baker, executive vice president of People for the American Way. It s ridiculous to think that the Senate could possibly give thorough consideration to a nominee with this many holes in his questionnaire. In response, Sessions submitted two additional pages of information on Thursday, including the listing of his judicial nomination. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D California, the incoming ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is urging Republicans to delay the confirmation hearing. In a letter to the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Feinstein suggested that a delay of the hearings might be necessary for two reasons Sessions incomplete questionnaire and the reams of information that the committee must investigate in less than a month. She noted that Sessions has more than years of public service and public statements that must be analyzed, and the , pages of information he handed over, while not a complete accounting, is too much to assess before January . Staff must have sufficient time to do the due diligence on any nominee for this vital position and this due diligence will likely take longer than the review for recent, prior nominees who had less materials to analyze, Feinstein wrote. Drew Courtney, communications director for PFAW, said No matter who the nominee is, the confirmation process for an attorney general needs to be taken seriously Given Donald Trump s dismissive attitude towards the Constitution, that s doubly true this year. Senator Grassley is doing the country a real disservice by trying to rush the process. But Sen. Grassley has indicated that he has no intention of postponing the hearings. It is no surprise that Senator Sessions twenty years of service as our colleague not to mention his service in the Department of Justice and to the State of Alabama yielded an extensive record, Grassley wrote in a letter responding to Feinstein. Severino defended Sessions in a statement. Senator Sessions has turned over more material than any nominee in history and is well known to the senators. Liberals are scrambling to delay because they don t want an attorney general who puts the American people and the rule of law ahead of political agendas, Severino said. This first battle is likely a sign of more conflicts to come over Sessions nomination as the hearings approach.",

        "text": "A record number of Americans signed up for Obamacare Thursday on what they thought would be the last day to enroll in health insurance coverage that starts in the new year, President Barack Obama said Friday. So many people visited the federal government website that the administration extended the deadline until early next week to give more people time to sign up for what could be the last year of Obamacare coverage. The Republicans who will control Congress and the White House starting next month say they ll repeal the law that provides the insurance markets as soon as they can although there s no clear plan for how, when or what to put in its place. Obama plugged the health insurance marketplace, the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, in his last press conference of the year before heading to Hawaii for vacation. Yesterday was the biggest day ever for Healthcare.gov. More than , Americans signed up to get coverage, Obama said. SINCE I SIGNED OBAMACARE INTO LAW, OUR BUSINESSES HAVE ADDED MORE THAN MILLION NEW JOBS. That s compared to , sign ups last year on the Dec. deadline. Obama said when he took office, million Americans lacked health insurance. Today, we have covered more than million of them, he said. For the first time in history, more than percent of Americans are insured. Republican opponents of Obamacare don t dispute the coverage numbers but say the law has failed to bring down costs for consumers, as had been promised. Related Most Americans Don t Want Obamacare Repealed Premiums have risen as insurance companies taking part in the exchanges have struggled to make the profits they seek given the other restrictions imposed by the law. Obamacare limits the ability to charge higher premiums for women and older people, and it forces insurers to take all comers, even people who are already sick. But the publicity over higher premiums didn t seem to scare off new customers. The Department of Health and Human Services said more than million people have signed up for coverage on Healthcare.gov, compared to about . million enrollments by the first week of December last year. That includes . million people not covered before and . million renewals. YESTERDAY WAS BIGGEST DAY EVER FOR HEALTHCARE.GOV. MORE THAN , AMERICANS SIGNED UP TO GET COVERAGE. Most people who buy private insurance on the health insurance marketplaces get a hefty federal subsidy to help pay the premiums. An analysis by the Center for Health and Economy found those subsidies would cost . billion next year, an increase of nearly billion over this year. Related Obamacare Repeal Would Take Insurance from Million People The enrollment numbers do not include health insurance marketplaces run by states and Washington, D.C. independently of the federal government. The new demand could help improve profitability for insurers, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. If the current Affordable Care Act open enrollment period is successful and enrollment grows, it means the insurance market is not collapsing, he said via Twitter. Because of the extraordinary demand, we extended the deadline to sign up for January coverage by two business days until pm PST December . We don t yet know how many people will take advantage of this extension, but nearly a million consumers left their contact information to hold their place in line, HHS said in a statement. Obama on Friday took a shot at critics who said the law would hurt business and employment by requiring larger employers to cover their workers. Since I signed Obamacare into law, our businesses have added more than million new jobs, he said.",

        "text": "President Obama has indefinitely blocked offshore drilling in areas of the Atlantic Ocean and in Arctic waters, a move aimed at advancing environmental protection during his final days in office. The Arctic protections are a joint partnership with Canada. These actions, and Canada s parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth, the White House said in a statement. They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region s harsh conditions is limited, the White House added. By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large scale oil and gas leasing production in the region at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels. This map shows the Atlantic areas that have been designated off limits to oil and gas explorations and development activity. White House Obama s action designates Atlantic canyons off limits to oil and gas exploration and development activity, totaling . million acres, according to the administration. It provides the same protections to much of the Arctic s waters, covering the vast majority of U.S. waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, totaling million acres. Canada is doing the same to all Arctic Canadian waters, the joint statement adds. Obama took these actions by invoking a law called the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which gives the president the authority to withdraw lands from oil and gas leases. But as NPR s Jeff Brady and Jennifer Ludden report, major questions remain about what will happen if the incoming Trump administration attempts to reverse this action. The White House says the president is acting within his authority, that Presidents of both parties have done this in the past, and trying to reverse such an order would be unprecedented if Trump tried to do this, Jeff said on All Things Considered. There is no legal precedent for reversal, Jeff reports. So if there s a legal challenge, and I m not going to be surprised if there is one, it s really not clear what a court would decide. This map shows the area that the U.S. has designated as indefinitely off limits to offshore oil and gas leasing. White House As Bloomberg reports, the statute doesn t include a provision for reversal and that action may take years to work its way through court. Environmental groups such as Oceana are celebrating the designation. President Obama has taken a key step in protecting important areas of the Atlantic Ocean from offshore drilling, as Jacqueline Savitz, the group s senior vice president for the United States, said in a statement. The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington. Representatives of the oil and gas industry are unhappy about the news. We think it s a very short sighted decision to take these areas off limits, Andy Radford, senior policy advisor for offshore issues at the American Petroleum Institute, told Jeff the action poses great risk to our energy security going forward and eliminates the opportunity to create jobs and help small businesses throughout the country. Earlier this year, the Obama administration reversed course on a plan that would have allowed Atlantic offshore drilling after uproar from local communities and environmentalists. Then, the administration designated the first national marine monument in the Atlantic Ocean. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that it has protected an Atlantic area about the size of New Jersey from deep sea commercial fishing.",

        "text": "Tuesday was supposed to be a day of triumph for Russian diplomacy, when Russia aimed to replace the United States as the indispensable power in the Middle East. Instead, it became a day of mourning, with a Turkish honor guard in Ankara loading the flag draped coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov onto a Moscow bound plane. Karlov, who was assassinated in an Ankara art gallery Monday evening, had been given the delicate mission of patching up relations after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane last year. On Tuesday, Karlov s efforts were to be crowned by a meeting in Moscow of the foreign and defense ministers of Russia, Turkey and Iran and the rise of a new power constellation in the Middle East. Those talks went ahead despite his death. Afterward, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared the three country format the most effective in resolving the Syrian conflict, since his talks with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had run aground. Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, accused Russia and Iran of bearing responsibility for atrocities committed during the Syrian government s assault on the city of Aleppo. With a lame duck administration in the White House for the next month, Russia is using territorial gains in Syria to seize the diplomatic initiative as well. Because the Syrian government s retaking of Aleppo has happened so fast, Lavrov agreed to move up the Moscow meeting with his Turkish and Iranian colleagues by a week. That s why the reaction to Karlov s murder by an off duty Turkish policeman who shouted about avenging the carnage in Aleppo before being shot to death himself was practically unanimous in Moscow. The official line from Russian President Vladimir Putin on down was that the assassination in Ankara was a provocation meant to derail the talks. Members of a Turkish honor guard carry the coffin of Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at the airport in Ankara. When Turkey shot down a Russian Su warplane along the Turkey Syria border in November , Putin s response was fast and furious. Diplomatic and economic relations were put on hold until last summer, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan finally issued an apology. On Monday, the blame in Moscow for the ambassador s killing was assigned to unnamed forces that are opposed to Russia and Turkey s rapprochement. Putin talked on the phone with Erdogan, who agreed to let in a team of Russian investigators. Putin needs Erdogan, and Erdogan needs Putin. The two leaders are facing isolation from traditional partners because of their policies against domestic opponents and militant nostalgia for bygone empires. What to do about Syria once a bone of contention between Russia and Turkey has become an opportunity for both countries to act as power brokers in a global crisis. The importance of that relationship is clear from the number of contacts the two countries have had since Erdogan s conciliatory visit to Russia back in August. In the space of the past month, Putin has been on the phone with Erdogan half a dozen times, and the Turkish leader is expected to travel to Russia again in January. Just a little more than a year ago, Putin was accusing Erdogan of a stab in the back and estimated ISIS oil sales via Turkey in the hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars. Now, responsibility for Karlov s assassination is being attributed to powers farther afield. Murder of our ambassador is continuation of information war against Russia. Media hysteria created conditions for it. Info attacks lead to terrorist attacks, Russian senator Alexei Pushkov tweeted on Tuesday. Russian nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who happens to hold a degree in Turkish studies, didn t shy away from blaming the West directly. Turkey is turning away from the West. That s disadvantageous for certain Western intelligence agencies, Zhirinovsky said on state television Monday night. The European Union and NATO are afraid that Russia will join forces with Iran and Turkey, he said, presenting the West with a formidable counterweight. So far, Karlov s efforts to that end have not been in vain.",

        "text": "Congress is preparing to do major battle next month over President elect Donald Trump s secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson, in a brewing proxy fight over Trump s potential financial conflicts of interest and his unconventional foreign policy. The official sparring is expected to take place on Jan. , when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to hold a two part hearing to grill Tillerson over his tenure as ExxonMobil s chief executive and what many lawmakers see as unseemly links to Russia. But behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, the strategizing has already begun. Democrats do not think they stand much chance of stopping Tillerson from being confirmed. But they plan to press the top diplomat designate to commit to full divestiture from Exxon and detail how he would pursue a different approach to the world as secretary of state, in what one Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to candidly discuss strategy called a very thorough, tough vetting. As they have with Trump, Democrats plan to focus sharply on potential conflicts of interest deriving from Tillerson s finances, as well as his views on critical foreign policy matters. It s a grilling they would happily give Trump, if only they had reason to drag him before a congressional committee. Already, the minority party is railing against Republicans for refusing to demand Tillerson produce his tax returns. Their frustration stems from Tillerson s response to a routine question about tax returns on the Foreign Relations Committee s pre hearing questionnaire. According to a Senate Democratic aide and a Trump transition team spokesman, Tillerson said he stood ready to provide only tax return information for himself and his wife for the previous three years. That means it s possible Tillerson isn t willing to provide complete returns. A battle is brewing over secretary of state designate Rex Tillerson s nomination on Capitol Hill. Evan Vucci AP Democrats have demanded that all Trump s Cabinet nominees release their tax returns something Trump himself steadfastly refused to do during the campaign, because, he said, the returns were under routine audit. Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker R Tenn. said the GOP would not break with years of precedent to compel Tillerson to turn over his tax returns without good reason, no matter how loud the clamor from Democrats. Unless there was a case where there s some irregularity that s known, the committee just does not ask for tax returns, Corker said in an interview. Corker said Tillerson is not going to be the proxy for Trump , because we re not going to ask for tax returns. I understand there are a number of Democrats who are very upset about President elect Trump not putting his tax returns, Corker said. But that s not going to change the way we go about our committee process. Senate Democrats believe they can fight miniature versions of the political battles they are waging with Trump during the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet choices particularly those such as Tillerson who hail from the private sector. They intend to focus on Tillerson s four decade career at a major oil conglomerate and what they and some Republicans see as questionable ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several Democratic members of the committee have said they also plan to ask Tillerson about human rights and climate change in light of his Exxon work. Many lawmakers are leaning on Trump to fully divest from his companies because his wide ranging business empire lends itself at the very least to an appearance of conflicts of interest. Democrats argue Tillerson s business career raises similar questions. Just how thorny those conflicts may be won t be clear until the committee receives Tillerson s financial disclosure statements, documents that Corker expects to have before the end of . Corker plans to give other committee members a copy of the disclosure as soon as we have it, providing ample time to review what is expected to be a very extensive document. Committee Democrats are planning to scour Tillerson s financials once they receive them and are exploring options to beef up their resources by borrowing tax and financial experts from other corners of the Hill or seconding Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department employees to help, according to an aide. The all in effort is vital, they argue, because unlike many previous secretaries of state, Tillerson has not had to publicize details about his personal finances. If confirmed, Tillerson would be the first secretary of state in decades who has not previously worked as a public servant or a member of the military. This proposed nominee for secretary of state will likely be asked more questions than normal. Secretary Kerry was somebody that we knew. Secretary Clinton was somebody that we knew, Corker said. Since Tillerson will be up under the hood advising the president on foreign policy, a president who hasn t been involved in foreign policy in his business life, we certainly want to understand fully the kind of advice he would be giving the president as secretary of state. Part of the logic behind planning a two part hearing one session in the morning and one in the afternoon , as Corker put it, is so there can be plenty, plenty, plenty of time for people to learn everything they want to from Tillerson. A particular point of concern for Democrats and Republicans will be Tillerson s relationship and business dealings with Putin, who awarded him the Kremlin s Order of Friendship in . Tillerson also opposed sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in as a reaction to the annexation of Crimea and Moscow s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, arguing that Exxon lost billion from the policy change. On Thursday, Corker had a minute conversation with Tillerson in which he questioned him about Russia, with the bulk of that conversation focusing on sanctions. He came away with the impression that Tillerson had no interest in ripping up existing sanctions on Russia, even if he criticized them as Exxon s CEO. That would be hugely problematic to this one senator, if I felt that was how we were going to begin the relations with Russia, Corker said, referring to himself. He noted the conversation alleviated some of the concerns he harbored about Tillerson s relationship with the Kremlin. Corker said he encouraged Tillerson to start calling other lawmakers on his committee. Tillerson and lead Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin Md. also spoke by phone Thursday, but a spokesman for Cardin would not detail what was discussed. On Tuesday, Tillerson was in Washington, where he met with Sen. Tom Cotton R Ark. , who endorsed his nomination. He hopes to meet with as many senators as possible to discuss his nomination, according to the Trump transition team. I think, at least I hope, that when these meetings take place that we re going to see a Rex Tillerson that has a standard view of Russia s malicious activities, nefarious activities, Corker said. I got a good sense of how he d approach Russia and Putin, and it was certainly different, if you will, than the picture of him toasting Putin with champagne. Several key GOP senators including John McCain Ariz. , Lindsey Graham S.C. and Marco Rubio Fla. have expressed concerns that Tillerson s ties to Russia could be a dangerous echo of Trump s seeming affinity for Putin. Those concerns have taken on even more urgency in wake of CIA allegations that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Trump. Since the president elect selected Tillerson, Trump s transition team has been rolling out foreign policy heavyweights such as Bob Gates, Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and Dick Cheney to vouch for Tillerson s global bona fides. Gates, Rice and Hadley run a consulting firm that has Exxon is a client. Only one Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee Rubio has publicly criticized Tillerson over his Kremlin ties, and he communicated those concerns directly to Corker before the nomination was formally announced. Democrats need only persuade one Republican to oppose Tillerson to block his nomination in committee. But it is still possible he could get to a floor vote even if the committee rejects him. In the past, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported out nominations unfavorably, a procedure that expresses the members discontent without blocking the full Senate from voting. In , the full Senate confirmed President Ronald Reagan s Arms Control and Disarmament Agency nominee, Kenneth Adelman, despite his rejection by the panel. But Corker expressed confidence that Tillerson would pass the committee s test, even if his track record as an oil company CEO gives members pause. My sense is, based on the conversation we had, he s going to very much understand that his job now is to pursue our country s national interest, Corker said.",

One was the news that Corey Lewandowski Donald Trump s former campaign manager who remained part of his inner circle long after leaving that job had just opened a full service government relations and consulting firm half a block from the White House. The other was that the president elect is apparently over drain the swamp. That s according to Newt Gingrich, a top ally who told NPR in an interview that aired Wednesday morning that he was instructed not to use the phrase anymore because it has fallen out of favor with Trump. I m told he now just disclaims that, Gingrich said on Morning Edition. He now says it was cute, but he doesn t want to use it anymore. Gingrich said he had written what I thought was a very cute tweet about the alligators are complaining, but that somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff. Gingrich actually drafted two tweets in recent days about draining the swamp tweets that apparently earned him the rebuke. But this should really come as no surprise. Trump himself has acknowledged his on again, off again relationship with the phrase. And it actually wasn t a mainstay in the campaign until the final days. Trump freely admitted that he never much liked the phrase, in fact. But he said that his crowds had prevailed upon him to embrace it. Drain the swamp. We put it in about two days ago. I said, Drain the swamp. I didn t like it. I didn t like the expression Drain the swamp in Washington, Trump said Oct. at a rally in North Carolina. So I said it three days ago the place went crazy.

Trump explains why he didn t like the phrase drain the swamp but now does Play Video At a rally in Kinston, N.C., Oct. , then presidential candidate Donald Trump said the phrase drain the swamp had been trending all over the world since he started using it. The Washington Post As admissions of political expediency go, this is pretty forthcoming. But it s also worth noting here that Trump s flip on this phrase seems to have come pretty suddenly. Just a day before Gingrich s first tweet above, Trump promised in Alabama to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. He said the same in Orlando the day before and in Hershey, Pa., the day before that. So it s not clear whether a specific story or cable news item which have a tendency to draw instant Trump policy directives and declarations might have influenced this change of course, if indeed it sticks. But what s clear is that Trump s efforts to drain the swamp have increasingly been derided and scoffed at as he has named a Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury Department and politicians and fellow billionaires to lead other departments.

The hard earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement, calling the alleged pay for play arrangement a classic, quid pro quo bribery scheme.

        "text": "The search warrant that authorized the FBI to examine a laptop in connection with Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server as secretary of state was released today, and the Clinton camp says it shows that Director James Comey s intrusion into the election was utterly unjustified. Clinton had been dogged by the issue of her private email server throughout the campaign and Comey dealt a surprise blow when he said that the FBI was looking into the emails found on former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner s computer just days before the election. According to the warrant and supporting documents, investigators said they found thousands of emails belonging to top Hillary Clinton adviser Huma Abedin on the computer belonging to her estranged husband, Weiner. Both of their names are redacted. The laptop s hard drive, according to sources, was being examined in unrelated investigations into alleged sexting by Weiner. Warrant Related to Clinton Emails to Be Unsealed Tuesday Warrant Obtained to Start Reviewing Emails Found on Laptop Used by Clinton Aide FBI Says Review of New Emails Doesn t Change Conclusion Clinton Shouldn t Be Charged When discovered, the FBI believed the emails were outside the scope of their investigation into Weiner, and did not look at them beyond the subject line and e mail address information, according to the newly released documents. According to the affidavit, the FBI had already reviewed more than , emails and found , contained classified information, including with Top Secret information. Analysis of those emails revealed more than , work related emails between redacted and Clinton from and . The redaction is believed to refer to Abedin. According to the affidavit, the FBI s prior investigation found that among the , , some email chains containing classified information have been transmitted through redacted and or redacted accounts, which again are believed to be between Abedin and Clinton. Because it has been determined by relevant original classification authorities that many emails were exchanged between redacted and or redacted accounts and Clinton that contained classified information, there is also probable cause to believe that the correspondence between them located on Subject Laptop contains classified information, the affidavit says. The FBI search of the laptop came during the final days of the presidential election, months after Comey announced that the bureau had effectively closed its investigation. E. Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles attorney who petitioned to have the documents unsealed, said in a statement to ABC News he was appalled. I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin, he said. On Oct. , Comey disclosed to Congress that the FBI would be looking at the newly discovered emails, but it remains unclear when the emails were discovered and how long it took for that information to be communicated to Comey. The warrant was approved two days later. Just two days before the election, Comey issued a second letter to Congress, stating, based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton. It s unclear what impact Comey s letters had on the election, but Clinton told top donors that she thought Comey s letter to Congress was a turning point in the contest between her and now President elect Donald Trump. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon tweeted today that the unsealed filings regarding Huma s emails reveals Comey s intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time. Stephen Saltzburg, George Washington University Law Professor, said that Comey didn t need to run the risk of making Clinton look even worse right before the election a move that broke with FBI protocol about commenting on ongoing investigations. They FBI had to assure themselves that there was no classified information at risk on a computer that they didn t have. They had no obligation, however, to go public about what they were doing, he said. Officials at both the FBI and the Department of Justice declined to comment to ABC News.",

        "text": "The campaign to rally support for Donald Trump s pick to head the Justice Department is growing, with former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who served under President Bill Clinton, now joining the effort. In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Freeh offered his strong recommendation that Senators confirm their colleague Jeff Sessions, R Ala., as the next attorney general, defending his record on civil rights, which has become a key concern for critics. I have known Jeff since when we worked together as prosecutors on one of the most important civil rights cases investigated and prosecuted by the United States Department of Justice, Freeh wrote. I have always been greatly impressed with his commitment to the rule of law, his fair and balanced prosecutorial judgment, and his personal dedication to protecting civil rights. What Jeff Sessions Has Said About Race and Civil Rights After Sessions was announced as Trump s pick for attorney general, top Democrats and some civil rights groups expressed concern over decades old allegations that he made racist remarks when he was U.S. Attorney in Alabama. Others alleged under oath during his confirmation hearings for a federal judgeship that he once called a white civil rights lawyer a disgrace to his race and dubbed some efforts by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People un American. During the hearings, one lawyer who worked with Sessions claimed the lawmaker told him he thought the KKK was OK until I found out they smoked pot. Sessions said the comment was a joke but apologized. Under oath himself, Sessions also insisted he harbored no racial bias and said the allegations were either false or being taken out of context. He was nevertheless blocked from becoming a judge. In his letter on Tuesday, Freeh pointed to Sessions work on the murders of a federal judge in Alabama and an NAACP official in Georgia. I was struck with Jeff s fierce determination to solve these civil rights murders, which so gravely impacted the rule of law and the guarantee of civil rights in America, Freeh wrote, noting that, Jeff and his office were key decision makers in formulating and implementing the investigative strategy which ultimately led to the arrest and conviction of Walter Moody for these murders. Meanwhile, a conservative judicial organization, the Judicial Crisis Network, has created an entire website devoted to pushing Sessions confirmation. He is a world class legal mind and a tough but fair lawyer with invaluable experience, says the website, ConfirmSessions.com. Known for his deep respect for the Constitution and adherence to the rule of law, Sen. Sessions has worked tirelessly to defend the civil rights and legal rights of all Americans. Democratic Party leaders, meanwhile, have called Sessions nomination deeply troubling. Over the course of his career, Senator Sessions used the power of the courts to discriminate against civil rights leaders, allegedly used racially charged language to disparage minorities, expressed support for the KKK and then tried to dismiss it as a joke, celebrated the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, opposed same sex marriage, denied the constitutionality of Roe v. Wade, voted against greater access to healthcare for veterans, blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, and voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, Democratic National Committee Interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement last month. Freeh, who served as FBI director from to June , expressed no such concerns, calling Sessions a friend who has had a distinguished career in public service. I believe that Jeff will be an outstanding Attorney General for the Nation, Freeh said.",

The draft invitation also listed Mr. Trump s two adult sons as honorary co chairmen of the event. But Tuesday afternoon, Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks denied the involvement of Mr. Trump s sons. The Opening Day event and details that have been reported are merely initial concepts that have not been approved or pursued by the Trump family, said Hicks in a statement.

        "text": "Donald Trump s transition team is asking State Department officials to reveal how much of their funding goes towards international environmental groups, according to a new Washington Post report. The query, posed in a list of questions to the State Department s Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs, asked, How much does the Department of State contribute annually to international environmental organizations in which the department participates? State Department spokesperson John Kirby noted Wednesday, however, that there is nothing out of hte norm regarding questions being asked by the transition team. The questions, Kirby told reporters, were very much aligned with their need to better understand the bureaucracy and organization that they re about to lead. Nothing falls outside the normal inquiries, Kirby said. Despite State Department assurances, the inquiry has increased worries that the president elect s transition team is prioritizing a rollback of the Obama administration s actions on climate change and conservation efforts. While Mr. Trump has met with prominent climate change activists since his election victory, the president elect has also tapped several people to lead government agencies that have agendas contrary to Mr. Obama s own climate and renewable fuel focus. For instance, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt who Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the Environmental Protection Agency is a vocal denier of climate change science and has even sued the Obama administration over its clean power plant rules. Mr. Trump s pick for secretary of state, oil magnate Rex Tillerson, has said climate change could pose significant risks, but there is little indication that the Exxon Mobil executive will prioritze the issue. Mr. Trump also threatened during his campaign to scuttle the United States involvement in the landmark Paris climate change accord, an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions and try to reverse global warming effects. The Paris treaty holds the U.S. accountable for donating billion over four years to the Green Climate Fund, which is devoted to helping poorer countries weather the detrimental effects of climate change. Similarly, the Energy Department was also recently sent a questionnaire to divulge the names of employees who had worked on climate change policies. The department said it would not be complying with that request, and the Trump transition team disavowed the original questionnaire, saying it was not authorized. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment confirming the Post report. According to the White House s Office of Management and Budget, of the State Department s budget of . billion, about million was allocated for natural resources and the environment. ",

        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. Legislators who passed the North Carolina law known as the bathroom bill nine months ago head back to the capital on Wednesday to consider repealing it. But there s uncertainty over exactly what lawmakers will do, in part because this Republican controlled legislature has shown a willingness to go its own way, despite intense outside pressure to scrap the law. Legislators returned to Raleigh for a special session called by GOP Gov. Pat McCrory to eliminate House Bill the bathroom bill which has been blasted by gay rights groups and resulted in job losses and sporting event cancellations. No repeal bill backed by Republicans had been made public by midday. Instead, House Republicans returned to a closed door meeting Wednesday morning that continued into the afternoon. They held a similar meeting that lasted for more than four hours Tuesday night. Some Republicans were unhappy after learning that Charlotte on Monday had not repealed its entire nondiscrimination ordinance, which had been the genesis of HB , Republican repeal supporter Rep. Chuck McGrady said. On a difficult issue where the parties don t have a lot of trust, we got thrown a curveball by the less than full repeal by Charlotte, McGrady tweeted early Wednesday. The fact that McCrory called lawmakers back to Raleigh a month before their session s start was challenged by an opponent of HB s repeal. There is no extraordinary circumstance, said Rep. Jeff Collins, R Nash, during a brief debate over session procedures, other than the extraordinary hubris of a city council telling us we have to act by a certain date. Monday s action by the Charlotte council was contingent on HB s repeal by Dec. . Over the past year, there has been bitter fighting between Democrats and Republicans. Just last week, Republican leaders convened a surprise legislative session and passed two laws designed to bring Democratic Gov. elect Roy Cooper s powers in check when he becomes governor Jan. . Cooper blasted McCrory over House Bill during the governor s race, and the fallout over the law job losses, canceled concerts and sporting events contributed to McCrory s narrow defeat. The wide ranging law is best known for requiring transgender people to use restrooms corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings. GOP Rep. Chuck McGrady of Hendersonville supports repealing the entire law and said he believes a significant number of House members from both parties do as well. Everybody is acting in good faith in my opinion, McGrady said. House Republicans met by phone Monday and would meet in person in Raleigh later Tuesday, he said. However, lawmakers were already under pressure from some conservative groups to keep HB in place. We re sending the message to our supporters that lawmakers should not now betray people who supported them and compromise common sense principles like privacy, dignity and freedom from our citizens, said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition. House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger have only issued a brief statement Monday, saying they would take up the repeal of HB . They also criticized Cooper for taking too much credit. They did not return messages for comment Tuesday. Charlotte appears to have held up its end of the bargain, but the measure enacted Monday notes that it s dependent on HB being repealed in its entirety by Dec. . That could give some lawmakers justification not to repeal it. Cooper, who helped broker Charlotte s cooperation with phone calls over the weekend, expects a full repeal, his spokeswoman Megan Jacobs said late Monday. The law also limits statewide protections for LGBT people in public accommodation and employment, and it reinforced a prohibition on local governments from raising minimum wage. Local governments are also prevented from enacting nondiscrimination measures that would go further than state law. The session is scheduled several days before Christmas, with some legislators out of town. GOP Rep. Jeff Collins of Rocky Mount, who voted for HB in March, told The Wilson Times that he was not interested in repealing anything. I think we did the right thing the first time, he told the newspaper. Passing a repeal would only require a handful of GOP support perhaps in the Senate or in the House if all Democrats voted for it. Discussions about repealing the law increased after decisions by the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference to move their championship events out of North Carolina this academic year. The NBA also moved an All Star Game out of Charlotte. Democratic Rep. Grier Martin of Raleigh said until there s a full repeal, I m pretty certain that we re not going to see another NBA All Star Game or NCAA tournament game in North Carolina. LGBT advocates said they were cautiously hopeful. We are holding out hope that the legislators will keep their word, said Simone Bell, Southern Regional Director for the LGBT rights group Lambda Legal. We want complete and full repeal of HB . ",

        "text": "PALM BEACH, Fla. President elect Donald Trump is planning to meet with his incoming national security adviser in the aftermath of a rattling day of violence around the world. Trump appeared to jump ahead of investigators in blaming Islamic terrorists for deadly incidents Monday in Turkey and Germany and vowing anew to eradicate their regional and global networks. He called the brazen shooting of Russia s ambassador to Turkey a violation of all rules of civilized order. He added that a radical Islamic terrorist had assassinated the diplomat, Andrei Karlov. Turkish authorities identified the gunman as Mevlut Mert Altintas, a member of Ankara s riot police squad, and said he was later killed in a shootout with police. Altintas shouted in Turkish about the Syrian city of Aleppo and also yelled Allahu akbar, Arabic for God is great. President elect Trump describes mission to fight terrorism As for Berlin, where at least people were killed and nearly hurt when a truck plowed through a Christmas market, Trump said the Islamic State group and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad. A man held by German authorities after the violence was later released after a lack of evidence to connect him to the incident. Trump s meeting scheduled Wednesday with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will come a day after Flynn and several other members of the incoming national security team met with Vice President elect Mike Pence in Washington. Aides said the meeting was planned before the acts of violence, though they were discussed. The gathering with Pence included retired Gen. John Kelly, Trump s nominee for head of the Department of Homeland Security retired Gen. James Mattis, the pick for defense secretary and Rex Tillerson, the head of Exxon Mobil and the intended nominee for secretary of state. While Trump has assembled his Cabinet at a quick pace, the process to fill out top White House jobs has been slowed by infighting among advisers. Some of Trump s earliest advisers have expressed concern to the president elect himself that they are getting boxed out in favor of those more closely aligned with incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has chaired the Republican National Committee. Among those whose future is still in flux is Corey Lewandowski, Trump s controversial first campaign manager who was fired after clashing with the president elect s family. On Monday, Lewandowski met with Jared Kushner, Trump s influential son in law, and could still be offered a job in the administration, though potentially one that would keep him out of the West Wing and away from the president. The president elect s transition team has said it expects to announce some White House positions in the coming days. Former FBI agent on how Berlin terror attack differs from Nice Trump met Tuesday with candidates for his unfilled Cabinet positions, including prospective hires to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, a beleaguered agency that the Republican businessman has vowed to overhaul. At Mar a Lago, Trump s palatial Florida estate, the president elect met with Luis Quinonez, who runs a company with military and health care ties and is said to be under consideration for VA secretary. He also interviewed Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, who was a top contender to replace Eric Shinseki when he resigned from the VA in . Cosgrove later withdrew from consideration. Trump repeatedly pledged during the campaign to fix the woes at the department and said he would take care of great veterans. But he also came under scrutiny for being slow in paying out money raised for veterans groups and for suggesting that strong veterans don t need treatment for mental health problems. Others said to be considered for the post include former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, Florida Rep. Jeff Miller and Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran and former CEO of Concerned Veterans for America. Trump is also considering Jovita Carranza, who worked in President George W. Bush s administration, as his choice for U.S. trade representative. She served as deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration under Bush. With just a handful of Cabinet posts to fill, Trump is facing some criticism for a lack of diversity in his senior team, which currently includes no Hispanics. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said Tuesday that it was deeply concerned at the lack of Hispanics considered for top jobs. Carranza was a member of Trump s Hispanic advisory council during the campaign. Pence, meanwhile, met in Washington with former Texas state official Susan Combs, who served both as state agriculture commissioner and comptroller. Trump also needs to fill the Agriculture Department slot. Transition officials did not immediately confirm if Combs is up for that post.",

        "text": "A historic number of faithless electors seven in total each cast their ballots on Monday for a candidate other than the one who won his or her state. What may be more surprising, given the level of protests against Donald Trump and the pressure exerted on Republican electors, is that a greater number were untrue to Hillary Clinton than to Mr. Trump. Among the electors chosen to represent their states in the Electoral College, five were faithless to the Democratic nominee and two to the Republican. Prior to this year, there hasn t been more than one faithless elector in any presidential election since . What is next for the Electoral College? Among the Democratic faithless electors was David Mulinix, of Hawaii, who cast his vote for Bernie Sanders instead of Hillary Clinton. He said he believes the Electoral College is outdated, according to Hawaii News Now, which also pointed out that though Hawaii forbids faithless electors, Mulinix s vote still counted and he would face no punishment because Hawaii has never bothered to come up with a penalty for breaking the law. Four of the faithless electors came from Washington, a state won by Clinton. Three of them Bret Chiafalo, year old Levi Guerra, and Esther John cast their votes for former Secretary of State Colin Powell, according to the Seattle Times. They also participated in a movement started by Chiafalo. The so called Hamilton Electors base their ideology on Alexander Hamilton one of the Founding Fathers who wrote about the Electoral College in the Federalist Papers. The fourth faithless elector, Robert Satiacum, voted for Faith Spotted Eagle a woman who is a member of the Yankton Sioux Nation, according to a local NBC affiliate. She played a public role in opposing the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. President elect Trump lost Texas elector Christopher Suprun to John Kasich. Another Texas elector, Bill Greene, voted for Libertarian Ron Paul, according to the Texas Monthly. Though there is no Constitutional provision or federal law barring electors from voting for whom they are pledged, more than half of the states, including D.C., bind their electors. The rest of electors may have the legal authority to vote for whomever they want, but, as CBS News previously reported, faithless electors have never decided a presidential election. The entire procedure lasted well into the evening, with the official tally coming in around p.m though the president elect clinched the nomination with the necessary votes earlier in the evening. According to a final tally, Trump received votes compared to Clinton s . The votes cast Monday will be sent on to the nation s capital by late December. Subsequently, on Jan. , Vice President Joe Biden will open the electoral votes before a joint session of the new Congress, where they will be counted one last time.",

        "text": "HONOLULU President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of U.S. owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing. The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr. Obama s environmental legacy while also testing President elect Donald Trump s promise to unleash the nation s untapped energy reserves. The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review. Mr. Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that the president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf. Environmental groups hope the ban, despite relying on executive powers, will be difficult for future presidents to reverse. The White House said it s confident the president s order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals. The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia, though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south. Existing leases aren t affected by the president s executive actions. The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium. Mr. Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive. Mr. Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic. Mr. Obama said just . percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in , and at current oil prices, significant production would not occur in future decades. That s why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector, Mr. Obama said. Still, industry officials objected to Mr. Obama s memorandum, calling it last minute political rhetoric. Instead of building on our nation s position as a global energy leader, today s unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come, said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. And Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said Mr. Obama s move marginalized local voices. He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected. To lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard, he said in a statement. In issuing a permanent ban, Mr. Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor. Mr. Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr. Obama s environmental and climate change actions. Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election, but Mr. Trump s victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing. Mr. Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self sufficiency and that it s time to open up offshore drilling. This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods, said Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president at the advocacy group, Oceana. A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr. Obama s decision should they seek to do so. The American Petroleum Institute pointed to when President George W. Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries. Fortunately, there is no such thing as a permanent ban, said the institute s Erik Milito. But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous indefinite withdrawals remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr. Obama s decision will stand. Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations. If Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obama s withdrawals, he will find himself in court, said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth. Frank Knapp, president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia, said he was extremely disappointed in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard. Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores, arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing, tourism and other businesses the region relies upon. He d gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials, and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected. The decision came as Mr. Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii. Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama, while some Republicans were highly critical. As President elect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet, President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections, said Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. The extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to amaze, countered Rep. Rob Bishop, R Utah, and chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. This is not a moral calling it s an abuse of power. ",

        "text": "A federal judge in New York has unsealed the search warrant obtained by the FBI to search Anthony Weiner s computer for emails related to Secretary Clinton s private server. The warrant was issued on Oct. , just two days after FBI Director James Comey had sent a letter to Congress revealing the possible existence of new emails related to the FBI s investigation into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server. The Department of Justice had previously announced that the investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information was closed, with a decision not to bring charges against anyone. Comey s letter to Congress said the new emails were discovered as part of an unrelated investigation, but he did not name or give details about the other investigation. FBI combs through Weiner s computer According to the warrant, law enforcement officials had asked the judge to authorize the search of a silver Dell Inspiron Series laptop computer. The warrant states that those officials had information indicating that there were thousands of emails on the laptop that could be related to the Clinton investigation. The FBI s application for the search warrant said that the laptop had never been authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information and that a complete forensic analysis and review of the device would allow the FBI to determine whether classified information had been mishandled or if the device had been hacked. The warrant was unsealed after E. Random Schoenberg sued to unseal the search warrant. He made it clear he was not interested in the unrelated investigation and was only seeking the warrant for the emails related to Secretary Clinton. Huma Abedin challenges the FBI In deciding whether to unseal the warrant, the judge noted that Clinton has little remaining privacy interest in the release of her documents identify her as the subject of her investigation. The Department of Justice initially opposed the unsealing, then withdrew its opposition and instead asked only that the documents be unsealed with certain redactions. The warrant was redacted to hide the identity of the subject of that other investigation who has been independently confirmed to be Anthony Weiner. The redactions also protect the identity of the law enforcement agents who worked on the case and applied for the warrant. Lawyers for Huma Abedin filed a letter in the case saying that the government never provided Abedin or her estranged ex husband Anthony Weiner with a copy of the warrant. Under federal law the officer executing the warrant must give a copy to the person whose property is taken. This case is slightly more complicated by the fact that the laptop had already been confiscated for the other investigation, a sexting scandal involving Weiner and a minor.",

        "text": "On Sunday evening, Donald Trump invited reporters to an off the record session at his Mar A Lago residence, where he s spending the holidays. Trump vows to eradicate Islamic terrorism in response to Berlin attack The press pool covering him reported, Trump stopped by a staff off the record with reporters at Mar a Lago, mingling for about a half hour and according to Trump press director Stephanie Grisham decided to go to dinner afterwards. We are told we can report the fact that Trump and Melania stopped by the OTR with reporters. It is not unusual for elected officials to hold off the record meetings with the press ostensibly to give journalists insight into the principal s thinking on an issue. This particular session took place as journalists continue to protest the fact that Mr. Trump has yet to hold a news conference since his election. It s now been days since his last news conference. He has, since the election, given interviews to CBS News, to New York Times reporters, and to Fox News, but the press conference he was to hold last week about the resolution of his business conflicts was postponed until the new year. Mike Allen, formerly of Politico and now of Axios, was there and sent a series of tweets about the meeting in the White and Gold ballroom, saying in one that Mr. Trump was relaxed and chatty and that pictures were allowed of the off the record session. Many of the journalists who attended, including Allen, saw an uptick in outraged tweets aimed at them, though this one, from cartoonist Ann Telnaes, summed up the reaction visually. In addition to Allen, AP s Evan Vucci, Reuters Steve Holland and Jonathan Lucas, ABC s Katherine Faulders and Hallie Jackson, Jeremy Diamond and Noah Gray of CNN, Ali Vitali of NBC, the Washington Post s Jabin Botsford, the New York Times Nick Corasaniti, Buzzfeed s Adrian Carrasquillo and Politico s Tara Palmeri attended, among others. Though the president elect has not yet held a press conference, he s hardly been silent since his election victory Mr. Trump is still tweeting regularly.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON Allegations of retaliation against a whistleblower at the National Security Agency have left its top watchdog fighting for his job, according to an intelligence official and another individual familiar with the case. The case could offer some credence to Edward Snowden s claim that he could not have reported the government s domestic surveillance program without facing reprisals. George Ellard, the NSA s inspector general, was placed on administrative leave after he refused to give the whistleblower a certain job assignment. The Project on Government Oversight, an advocacy group, first reported last week that Adm. Mike Rogers, director of NSA, had placed Ellard on leave and recommended that he be terminated. Ellard is appealing that decision. Ellard received attention in for remarks at Georgetown University Law Center criticizing Snowden, the former NSA contractor who had leaked secret documents about the surveillance program. Snowden says he went public because he feared retaliation from his superiors if he had raised his concerns with them. Ellard said at Georgetown that Snowden could have safely come to him. Ellard s case is the first to move completely through a process created by President Barack Obama in to ensure that intelligence employees can effectively report waste, fraud and abuse while protecting classified information. The directive prohibits agencies from retaliating against them or taking away security clearances or an employee s access to classified information. The case stemmed from a whistleblower s claims of financial misconduct by NSA officials involving a conference in Nashville, Tennessee. The whistleblower, in a brief email to The Associated Press, said that after he raised his concerns, his name was disclosed to Ellard in violation of rules intended to protect government employees who want to report misconduct. The whistleblower said his email response had been cleared by the NSA. The agency declined to comment independently on the case. Ellard s attorney did not respond to requests for comment. It s not clear who revealed the whistleblower s identity to Ellard. But the whistleblower said that after Ellard learned who he was, I was denied an assignment within the NSA inspector general s office of investigations because of my whistleblowing. He sent the email to the AP on condition of anonymity because the case is still active. Rogers decision to recommend Ellard s dismissal followed an eight month investigation by a panel of inspectors general at the CIA, Treasury and Justice Department, according to an intelligence official, who was not authorized to disclose details about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. The trio was empaneled in October and issued its decision in May. The Justice and Defense departments declined to comment on the decision. Louis Clark, director of the Government Accountability Project, said he was happy that the process set up by Obama s directive was finally being used, but expressed disappointment that it has taken so long for it to happen. It was so slow because the intelligence agencies are extremely hostile to whistleblowing, he said. The fate of Obama s directive is uncertain. It will be up to Donald Trump, after he becomes president, to decide whether to continue it. Trump has said he doesn t trust the intelligence agencies, but it s not clear if that would make him more or less likely to protect whistleblowers. Timothy Edgar, Obama s first director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff, says there is cause for serious concern about the future of whistleblowers. What we re left with, I think, is probably primarily the integrity and bravery of people in the bureaucracy, who, despite those obstacles are willing to say no if they are involved in activities that they think are serious violations of the Constitution, Edgar said.",

        "text": "A group of millennial activists from across the country plan to open a movement house in Washington DC next month, which will serve as a permanent base to protest Donald Trump s presidency. The organizers are mostly women of color, many of whom campaigned for Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. The house, which will be set up by inauguration day on January, has been dubbed District , in a reference to a rebellious neighborhood in the Hunger Games books and films. Activists told the Guardian that it will serve as a space for the best kinds of troublemakers from around the country . The property will be located in Capitol Hill, close to the White House and the Capitol building, and will enable activists to quickly mobilize against Trump should he court controversy during his presidency. Ripples of a revolution what will Bernie Sanders supporters do next? Read more Ultimately it s to make sure we hold him accountable, said Moumita Ahmed, the founder of Millennials for Revolution, a group which span off from the Bernie Sanders supporting Millennials for Bernie. Because his presidency is not normal at all. It s our duty to make sure he doesn t succeed. If he succeeds it s a message that everything he stood for is OK. That it s OK to get to power in the way that he did, and hurt all the people he s hurt. District will be open to activist groups around the country who wish to demonstrate in the capital, Ahmed said. The house is inspired by movement houses from the civil rights era, which served as a safe haven for people to plan marches and protests. People from ethnic minority activist groups, such as African Americans for Bernie and Color of Change, are involved in planning for the movement house, while climate change and minimum wage campaigners have also contributed. Most of the people involved are people who will most definitely be affected by this administration, Ahmed said. As someone who is from a Muslim family, I m invested in the safety of my community. And I see this administration as a threat to my community, especially because of the rhetoric that was used to become the president. The groups launched a crowdfunding effort on Tuesday to support District . They aim to reach , , which will cover the house s rent for one year. Erika Peralta, who has worked for Color of Change an organization with more than one million members that works to create a more human and less hostile world for black people in America is another organizer of District . She plans to live in the house for the first three months of Trump s presidency. The aim is to be a focal point and a nexus for activists and progressive people across the country to provide them resources and aid and our networks to stop any hatred that may come from the White House or to stand up against it, Peralta said. We re going to work to make sure that whatever Trump is trying to do, whether it s a Muslim registry or deport a bunch of immigrants, we re not going to let that happen. ",

For months, we have been keeping track of all of the GOP politicians, administration officials, business leaders and donors who have crossed over to back Clinton over Donald Trump. The most recent high profile announced was from former secretary of state Colin Powell. General Powell said at a meeting of the Long Island Association that he would be voting for Hillary Clinton, spokeswoman Peggy Cifrino said in late October. Powell added in a brief interview with The Post s Karen DeYoung that he picked Clinton because I think she s qualified, and the other gentleman is not qualified. Powell s support isn t much of a surprise, given his support for President Obama in and and clear distaste for Donald Trump. In his leaked emails from last month, Powell also appeared to be talking over the best time to announce his support for Clinton. But at least it s official now. And Powell is now the third Bush Cabinet official to support Clinton. Below is that list as it stands Former presidents ? George H.W. Bush ? Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a Facebook post that Bush told her this in person. The president s office isn t confirming it, but she stands by it. That s what he said, she told Politico Members of Congress Rep. Richard Hanna N.Y. , a moderate Republican who is retiring this year, told Syracuse.com that he will support Clinton and that Trump is unfit to lead. He cited Trump s criticism of Khizr Khan.

Clinton has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time.

America needs the kind of stable and aspirational leadership Secretary Clinton can provide. Marc Andreessen, venture capitalist Silicon Valley wouldn t be here, we wouldn t be doing any of this if we didn t have the amazing flow of immigrants that we ve had in the last years. And the idea of choking that off just makes me sick to my stomach. Harry Sloan, head of Global Eagle Acquisition He is unprepared and temperamentally unfit to be our president. Most of my Republican friends feel the same way. As a businessman, a father and a conservative, it is clear to me that Hillary Clinton is the right choice in this election. Dan Akerson, former chairman and chief executive of General Motors Serving as the leader of the free world requires effective leadership, sound judgment, a steady hand and, most importantly, the temperament to deal with crises large and small. Donald Trump lacks each of these characteristics. Chuck Robbins, chief executive of Cisco Hamid Moghadam, chairman and chief executive of Prologis Our country is about tolerance and inclusion and that s why, as a lifelong Republican supporter, I endorse Hillary Clinton for president in this election. William Oberndorf, donor of million to GOP candidates since If it is Trump vs. Clinton, and there is no viable third party candidate, I will be voting for Hillary Clinton.

She s the lesser of two evils. Political operatives David Nierenberg, finance chairman to Mitt Romney s campaign Mark Salter, former top adviser to John McCain Whatever Hillary Clinton s faults, she s not ignorant or hateful or a nut. She acts like an adult and understands the responsibilities of an American president. That might not be a ringing endorsement. But in , the year of Trump s s campaign, it s more than enough. Sally Bradshaw, former top Jeb Bush adviser, told CNN that she had left the Republican Party to become an independent because of Trump s presence at the top of the ticket and that if the race were close in her home state of Florida this fall, she would be voting for Clinton. As much as I don t want another four years of President Barack Obama s policies, I can t look my children in the eye and tell them I voted for Donald Trump. Ana Navarro, Florida GOP consultant and frequent CNN guest Maria Comella, former spokeswoman for two of Trump s top backers, Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani Instead of speaking out against instances of bigotry, racism and inflammatory rhetoric whether it s been against women, immigrants or Muslims, we made a calculus that it was better to say nothing at all in the interest of politics and winning elections. Kurt Bardella, former top aide to Rep. Darrel Issa R Calif. and ex spokesman for Breitbart News A big reason why I decided that Hillary Clinton is the candidate who I m voting for the first Democrat I m voting for in my life is because this is a time where what s going on is much bigger than partisanship, bigger than Republican or Democrat, or single issues that traditionally these campaigns are about. Mike Treiser, former Mitt Romney aide In the face of bigotry, hatred, violence, and small mindedness, this time, I m with her. Craig Snyder, former chief of staff to then Republican Sen.

        "text": "CLEVELAND Avik Roy is a Republican s Republican. A health care wonk and editor at Forbes, he has worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio. Much of his adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative ideals. But when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention, he said something I ve never heard from an establishment conservative before The Grand Old Party is going to die. I don t think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way, he said. There s going to be a disruption. Roy isn t happy about this He believes it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time. But he also believes the Republican Party has lost its right to govern, because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans. Until the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle, it will not have the moral authority to lead the country, he told me. This is a standard assessment among liberals, but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker. Our conversation had the air of a confessional of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong, had failed, had sinned. His history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy. It begins with a fatal error in , survived on the willful self delusion of people like Roy himself, and ended with Donald Trump. I think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken, Roy tells me. Trump is not a random act. This election is not a random act. The conservative movement s founding error Barry Goldwater In , William F. Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review, focusing on a free market, social conservatism, and a muscular foreign policy. Buckley s ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in , with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater lost the general election, his ideas eventually won out in the GOP, culminating in the Reagan Revolution of . Normally, Goldwater s defeat is spun as a story of triumph how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP. But according to Roy, it s the first act of a tragedy. Goldwater s nomination in was a historical disaster for the conservative movement, Roy tells me, because for the ensuing decades, it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights. THE GRAVITATIONAL CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WHITE NATIONALISM Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of . He himself was not especially racist he believed it was wrong, on free market grounds, for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate. But this principled stance identified the GOP with the pro segregation camp in everyone s eyes, while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti racism. This had a double effect, Roy says. First, it forced black voters out of the GOP. Second, it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats. Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress, the post Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites. The fact is, today, the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans, Roy says. Conservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem. Conservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP hence Trump Avik Roy L discusses Obamacare on television. William B. Plowman NBC NBC News Getty Images The available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that really was a pivotal political moment, in exactly the way Roy describes. Yet Republican intellectuals have long denied this, fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights. In , National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was popular but indefensible. This revisionism, according to Roy, points to a much bigger conservative delusion They cannot admit that their party s voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals. Conservative intellectuals, and conservative politicians, have been in kind of a bubble, Roy says. We ve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism philosophical, economic conservatism. In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism. Conservative intellectuals, for the most part, are horrified by racism. When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality, they really mean it. Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented, they need to believe that the party isn t racist. So they deny the party s racist history, that its post success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats embrace of civil rights. And they deny that to this day, Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty. It s the power of wishful thinking. None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that we ve inherited, Roy says. He expands on this idea It s a common observation on the left, but it s an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasn t true which is that conservatism has become, and has been for some time, much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy. I think today, even now, a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem. This, Roy believes, is where the conservative intellectual class went astray. By refusing to admit the truth about their own party, they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trump s rise. They told themselves, over and over again, that Goldwater s victory was a triumph. But in reality, it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive. Trump s politics of aggrieved white nationalism labeling black people criminals, Latinos rapists, and Muslims terrorists succeeded because the party s voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights. Trump tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement but a lot of people in the conservative movement didn t notice, Roy concludes, glumly. For conservatism to live, the conservative movement has to die A sign with one of the RNC s most popular slogans. Bill Clark CQ Roll Cal Over beers, I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally. His answer is very sad. When Marco Rubio lost, I went through the five stages of grief. It was tough. I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life, he says. I left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work. I did it because I felt it was important, and I care about the country. Maybe it s cheesy to say that, but I really sincerely do, he continues. So then, okay, what do I do? Do I do the same things I ve been doing for the last four years? To me, just to do that to collect a paycheck didn t make a lot of sense. This soul searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion The Republican Party, and the conservative movement that propped it up, is doomed. Both are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act, but that just isn t a winning formula in a nation that s increasingly black and brown. Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share. Either the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right of center party emerging in its place, or a third party will emerge, la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the s , Roy says. The work of conservative intellectuals today, he argues, is to devise a new conservatism a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America. I think it s incredibly important to take stock, he says, and build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty. I don t know how this would work. I don t think Roy knows either. For the entire history of modern conservatism, its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism. That s Roy s own diagnosis, and I think it s correct. As a result, we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy. I ve read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non racist conservative ideals. Writers like Andrew Sullivan, Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, Michael Brendan Dougherty, and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have. But not one of these writers, smart as they are, has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice. The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans, whereas liberalism and social democracy are. The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roy s cranky old white people and they re dying off. Maybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem. I hope they do. America needs a viable, intellectually serious right of center party. Because we now know what the alternative looks like. It s Donald Trump.

        "text": "All politicians bend the truth to fit their purposes, including Hillary Clinton. But Donald J. Trump has unleashed a blizzard of falsehoods, exaggerations and outright lies in the general election, peppering his speeches, interviews and Twitter posts with untruths so frequent that they can seem flighty or random even compulsive. However, a closer examination, over the course of a week, revealed an unmistakable pattern Virtually all of Mr. Trump s falsehoods directly bolstered a powerful and self aggrandizing narrative depicting him as a heroic savior for a nation menaced from every direction. Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, described the practice as creating an unreality bubble that he surrounds himself with. The New York Times closely tracked Mr. Trump s public statements from Sept. , and assembled a list of his biggest whoppers, many of them uttered repeatedly. This total excludes dozens more Untruths that appeared to be mere hyperbole or humor, or delivered purely for effect, or what could generously be called rounding errors. Mr. Trump s campaign, which dismissed this compilation as silly, offered responses on every point, but in none of the following instances did the responses support his assertions. Tall Tales About Himself Mr. Trump s version of reality allows for few, if any, flaws in himself. As he tells it, the polls are always looking up, his policy solutions are painless and simple and his judgment regarding politics and people has been consistent and flawless. The most consistent falsehood he tells about himself may be that he opposed the war in Iraq from the start, when the evidence shows otherwise. He said a supportive crowd chanted, Let him speak! when a black pastor in Flint, Mich., asked Mr. Trump not to give a political speech in the church. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . There were no such chants. I was against going into the war in Iraq. SPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. . This is not getting any truer with repetition. He never publicly expressed opposition to the war before it began, and he made supportive remarks to Howard Stern. He said any supportive comments he made about the Iraq war came long before the war began. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . He expressed support for the war in September , when Congress was debating whether to authorize military action. He said he had publicly opposed the Iraq war in an Esquire interview pretty quickly after the war started. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . The Esquire interview appeared in the August edition, months after the war began. Before the Iraq invasion, he said, he had told the Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto something pretty close to Don t go in, and don t make the mistake of going in. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . Not remotely close. He told Mr. Cavuto that President George W. Bush had to take decisive action. He said that when Howard Stern asked him about Iraq in , it was the first time the word Iraq was ever mentioned to me. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . Mr. Trump expressed alarm about Saddam Hussein and the situation in Iraq in in his own book. You see what s happening with my poll numbers with African Americans. They re going, like, high. SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. MADE SAME CLAIM IN OHIO, SEPT. . Polls show him winning virtually no support from African Americans. Almost, it seems, everybody agrees with his position on immigration. REMARKS IN TEXAS, SEPT. . Most Americans oppose his signature positions on immigration. He has made a lot of progress with Hispanic and black voters, and you see that in the polls. FRED DICKER RADIO SHOW, SEPT. . No major poll has shown him making up significant ground with black or Hispanic voters. He was never a fan of Colin Powell. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . In his book The America We Deserve, he named Mr. Powell as among the best and brightest in American society. Mr. Trump said that after The Times published an article scrutinizing his relationships with women, All the women came out and said they think Donald Trump is terrific. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . Only one woman who was quoted in the article came to his defense after its publication. Unlike other people who only raise money for themselves during presidential campaigns, he also raises money for the Republican Party. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . Every presidential nominee forms a joint fund raising agreement to share money with his or her national party. Unfounded Claims About Critics and the News Media It s not just Mrs. Clinton whom Mr. Trump belittles and tars with inaccurate information. He also distorted the facts about his Republican critics, including President George Bush and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. And he claimed that Lester Holt, the NBC anchor moderating the first presidential debate, is a Democrat but Mr. Holt is a registered Republican. In the primaries, Mr. Kasich won one and, by the way, didn t win it by much that was Ohio. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . Mr. Kasich crushed him in Ohio, winning by percentage points. Lester Holt, the NBC anchor and debate moderator, is a Democrat. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . Mr. Holt is a registered Republican, New York City records show. The presidential debate moderators are all Democrats. It s a very unfair system. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW, SEPT. . Only one, Chris Wallace of Fox News, is a registered Democrat. He said it hasn t been reported that Mrs. Clinton called some Trump supporters deplorable. SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. . It would be difficult to find a news organization that didn t report her remark. Inaccurate Claims About Clinton Mr. Trump regularly dissembles about his opponent, attributing ideas to Mrs. Clinton that she has not endorsed, or accusing her of complicity in events in which she had no involvement. Hillary Clinton and her campaign of started the birther controversy. I finished it. REMARKS IN WASHINGTON, SEPT. . Mrs. Clinton and her campaign never publicly questioned President Obama s birthplace Mr. Trump made it his signature cause for five years. Mrs. Clinton had the power and the duty to stop the release of unauthorized immigrants whose home countries would not accept their deportation after they were released from prison. NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN COLORADO, SEPT. , AND FLORIDA, SEPT. . The secretary of state does not have the power to detain convicted criminals after they have served their sentences, and has little power to make foreign countries accept deportees. Mrs. Clinton has not criticized jihadists and foreign governments that oppress and kill women, gay people and non Muslims. Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? No. SPEECH IN FLORIDA, SEPT. . She has denounced jihadists and foreign countries on the same grounds, if not necessarily using the same words. Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning. TWITTER, SEPT. . He did not invent the tarmac rally or the campaign plane backdrop. Mrs. Clinton destroyed smartphones with a hammer while she was secretary of state. SPEECHES IN FLORIDA, SEPT. AND SEPT. . An aide told the F.B.I. of only two occasions in which phones were destroyed with a hammer. He said Mrs. Clinton is calling for total amnesty in the first days, including a virtual end to immigration enforcement and for unauthorized immigrants to receive Social Security and Medicare. SPEECH IN COLORADO, SEPT. . She has not proposed this. Mrs. Clinton is effectively proposing to abolish the borders around the country. NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN TEXAS, SEPT. . She is not even proposing to cut funding for the Border Patrol. Hillary Clinton s plan would bring in , refugees in her first term alone, and would cost billion. NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. . She endorsed admitting , Syrian refugees this year, on top of other admissions. Mr. Trump is falsely claiming that she wants to do this every year and is estimating the cost accordingly. Stump Speech Falsehoods Some warped or inaccurate claims have become regular features of Mr. Trump s stump speech. He routinely overstates the scale and nature of the country s economic distress and the threats to its national security, and exaggerates the potential for overnight improvements if he were elected. Our African American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they ve ever been in before ever, ever, ever. SPEECH IN NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. . No measurement supports this characterization of black America. Fifty eight percent of black youth are not working. NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. , AND COLORADO, SEPT. . This misleading statistic counts high school students as out of work. Black youth unemployment actually was . percent in July. Many dangerous refugees are being welcomed by the Obama administration. Hundreds of thousands of people are being approved to pour into the country. We have no idea who they are. NEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. . The Obama administration has admitted more than , Syrian refugees, using an extensive screening process. We have cities that are far more dangerous than Afghanistan. NUMEROUS SPEECHES, INCLUDING IN FLORIDA, SEPT. COLORADO, SEPT. NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. OHIO, SEPT. AND A FOX NEWS INTERVIEW ON SEPT. . No American city resembles a war zone, though crime has risen lately in some, like Chicago. Urban violence has fallen precipitously over the past years. Ford plans to cut American jobs by relocating small car production to Mexico, and may move all production outside the United States. FOX NEWS INTERVIEW AND NEW HAMPSHIRE SPEECH, SEPT. . Mark Fields, Ford s chief executive, said it was not cutting American jobs. We have a trade deficit this year with China of approximately billion. NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH, SEPT. . He has made this claim repeatedly, but the trade deficit with China is significantly smaller. Esoteric Embellishments Mr. Trump often dissembles on subjects of passing interest, like the news of the day or the parochial concerns of his local audiences. But his larger pattern of behavior still holds These misstatements, too, accentuate the grievances of his supporters, and cast his own ideas in a more favorable light. Senator Bernie Sanders fell victim to a rigged system with the superdelegates. SPEECHES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, SEPT. , AND NORTH CAROLINA, SEPT. . Mr. Sanders did not lose the Democratic nomination because of superdelegates. Mrs. Clinton beat him in pledged delegates, too. ",

        "text": " m cool with you removing me from your friends list if you don t like this post. You can even disown me if you like. But Donald Trump isn t a good person, nor would he be a good president. I can understand a difference in politics. I can understand if you don t like a government run by Democrats. I can understand if you don t like certain ideologies, like Socialism. But I can t understand why you would support someone as hateful, sexist, racist and ignorant as Donald Trump. How do you support him so blindly? Ask yourself, are you a racist, sexist, hateful and ignorant person as well? I hear his supporters saying they like him because he tells the truth, because he s so rich he can say whatever he feels like with no apologies. Just because Trump is saying these things doesn t suddenly make them right. It s not okay to discriminate against an entire religion based on a small percentage of its followers who have become terrorists by twisting the words of the religion to fit their crazy ideals. It s not okay to marginalize an entire race of people, saying things like all the Mexicans are lazy, that they are all stealing our jobs and bringing drugs into our country. White people also have bad apples. So does every race of people. We re all human. Some humans are really bad people. Some are really good. And it doesn t matter what color they are, it makes no difference whatsoever. Trump says he is just telling the truth. But whose truth? There are lazy people in every race and there are dangerous violent people in every race and every religion. Kicking all Muslims out of the country is not the answer, nor is it the acceptable behavior of a person in an extremely powerful position, like the President of the United States. The Japanese Internment camps were wrong, Segregation was wrong, Slavery was wrong. We fought wars amongst ourselves to rise above racism and hatred. In WWII more than million people died worldwide. Why? Because of twisted people who were whipping up the population into a frenzy and making ridiculous statements, killing innocent people simply because of their race or religion. The United States lost more than , lives fighting in that war, against the same ideas that Trump is pushing. The idea that certain religions are more dangerous than others and the idea that people should be judged based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their character. They always say it s so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But I m not sure if it s ever been more important than now. We re still healing from the damage inflicted by the Civil War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, Iraq and the War on Terror. And it isn t just ISIS or Al Qaeda. It s our own people in this country killing their fellow countrymen over differences of opinion, like whether or not you believe abortion is okay or what kind of political ideology you support. And then there are just the plainly insane people who finally snap and go on shooting rampages for no discernible reason at all. They just went mad. The kind of leadership Trump is displaying is irresponsible and dangerous. His virulent ideas are seeping into the brains of his supporters. Supporters who think it s okay to say things like light the mother ! er on fire while a protester is being dragged out of one of his rallies. Maybe the protester was wrong to be where he was at the time, but no matter what he did, there was no reason to set him on fire. In fact, there is NEVER a reason to set anyone on fire. Unless it s because they are dead and they wish to be cremated. Trump s supporters are angry, and anger is infectious. I can tell you as a non supporter of Trump I am just as angry. We need the kind of leader that seeks to bring us together, not tear us apart. Why do we have to fight against helping each other, against common sense, against a united Nation? The American Dream is a nightmare and we are feeding it, making it worse every day. Trump is a bully, a loud mouth, ignorant, sexist, racist, disgusting example of how horrible humans can potentially be. He is the crazy person at your dinner table who won t stop running his mouth. The only reason he is allowed to carry on with his ugly hateful rhetoric is because you have too much respect for Grandma to get into a fist fight in her home. He s the guy you have to endure until he leaves, all the while hating every minute that you have to occupy the same space. Lucky for us, this isn t Grandma s house, so feel free to punch him in the mouth in the form of getting out and making your vote count. They always say it s so important to make your voice heard, to get out and vote. But I m not sure if it s ever been more important than now. Differences of political ideals are one thing, I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isn t one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women or the judgment of others based on their appearance or their disability, or their sexual preference. By supporting Trump do you think things will go back to the way they were? Back when gay people had to hide in fear, back when people of any other color than white had to worry about getting lynched, back when it was okay to openly hate? Do you think empowered women will suddenly quit their jobs and go back to the kitchen ? Because electing Trump won t make any of that come true. We re past that as a nation, or at least I thought we were. I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics, but racism isn t one of them, neither is hate, neither is the belittling of women... If you re not a racist, bigoted, misogynistic jerk, then voting for Trump simply because you don t like Democrats is wrong. If you are one of his supporters and you re just a racist and you don t care who knows it then vote for him, but know that the good people of America will not stand for it and he will never win a fair election. And please consider pursuing an education and work on your empathy toward your fellow human beings. Whatever led you to believe that racism is okay can be unlearned if you open your mind. I m sorry that you were raised to believe that you deserve better treatment than the rest of the people on the planet that have different views than yours, worship different gods than you and have skin that isn t white. To all the people, of all the races and religions that Donald Trump stands against, to all the women that don t meet his standards of beauty, to all the good Muslims, and Christians, Mormons and Catholics and Jewish, Italians, Irish and Asians, to the African Americans and Native Americans, to anyone who has ever been persecuted, belittled, made to feel inferior or bullied based on ignorance like the kind that Trump is spewing, please, I implore you to get out and vote against him. Don t let the progress of this great nation be halted. We ve come too far. In this country we FIGHT and DIE for freedom, for Truth and Justice. We fight for what s right. And what Trump is doing and saying isn t right. Some have attributed the following statement to Abraham Lincoln I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for safety of my country corporations have been enthroned, an era of corruption in High Places will follow, and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People, until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic destroyed. And he couldn t be more right. Trump IS the one percent, he IS working on your prejudices, and he WILL destroy the Republic if he is elected, make no doubt about it. If you don t believe me, just look at the level of crazy coming out of his own mouth I am calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on Donald Trump. That s religious discrimination. An extremely credible source has called my office and told me that Barack Obama s birth certificate is a fraud Donald Trump. That s an outright lie. Arianna Huffington is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man he made a good decision. Donald Trump. This is sexism, and just plain rude. You know, it really doesn t matter what the media write as long as you ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of ! . Donald Trump. This is misogyny at its finest. I will build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me and I ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. Donald Trump. The words of an arrogant hate monger. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending the best. They re not sending you, they re sending people that have lots of problems and they re bringing those problems with us. They re bringing drugs. They re bringing crime. They re rapists... And some, I assume, are good people. Donald Trump. Racist. Our great African American President hasn t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore. Donald Trump. Racist. If I were running The View , I d fire Rosie O Donnell. I mean, I d look at her right in that fat, ugly face of hers, I d say Rosie, you re fired. Donald Trump. The words of an ! . The beauty of me is that I m very rich. Donald Trump. So Vain. It s freezing and snowing in New York we need global warming! Donald Trump. Ignorant. My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my body. Donald Trump. Gross. I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I m more honest and my women are beautiful. Donald Trump. Sexist. As if women are possessions rather than people. And also a lie. A lie about how honest he is. How can you support this man? I am aware of the fact that snopes.com claims the Lincoln Capitalism Prophecy quote is false. It s a quote that has been going around for more than a hundred years. The quote has also been attributed to a letter that Lincoln supposedly wrote to Col. William F. Elkins in . Scholars have cited The Lincoln Encyclopedia The Spoken and Written Words of A. Lincoln Arranged for Ready Reference by Archer H. Shaw. Snopes still claims the letter referred to in this encyclopedia is a fraud, forged by Emanuel Hertz in his book Abraham Lincoln A New Portrait. So in the interest of full disclosure, these may or may not have been Lincoln s words. Whether they were written by Hertz or Lincoln, they were still written and they still pertain to the point I was trying to make. Income inequality is a serious issue in this country, and Donald Trump is working on the prejudices of the people.",

        "text": " DON T go anywhere near a mosque, I told my mother. Do all your prayer at home. O.K.? We re not going, she replied. I am the son of Muslim immigrants. As I sent that text, in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Orlando, Fla., I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshiped. Being Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage. In our culture, when people think Muslim, the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Kareem Abdul Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction. It s of a scary terrorist character from Homeland or some monster from the news. Today, with the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels. It s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense. Aziz Ansari s parents, Fatima and Shoukath Ansari Credit Photo courtesy Aziz Ansari There are approximately . million Muslim Americans. After the attack in Orlando, The Times reported that the F.B.I. is investigating , potential homegrown violent extremists, a majority of whom are most likely connected in some way to the Islamic State. If everyone on that list is Muslim American, that is . percent of the Muslim American population. If you round that number, it is percent. The overwhelming number of Muslim Americans have as much in common with that monster in Orlando as any white person has with any of the white terrorists who shoot up movie theaters or schools or abortion clinics. I asked a young friend of mine, a woman in her s of Muslim heritage, how she had been feeling after the attack. I just feel really bad, like people think I have more in common with that idiot psychopath than I do the innocent people being killed, she said. I m really sick of having to explain that I m not a terrorist every time the shooter is brown. I myself am not a religious person, but after these attacks, anyone that even looks like they might be Muslim understands the feelings my friend described. There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else. I understand that as far as these problems go, I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor. When someone on the street gives me a strange look, it s usually because they want to take a selfie with me, not that they think I m a terrorist. But I remember how those encounters can feel. A few months after the attacks of Sept. , I remember walking home from class near N.Y.U., where I was a student. I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled Terrorist! To be fair, I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed, but I m not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human history. The vitriolic and hate filled rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump isn t so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window. He has said that people in the American Muslim community know who the bad ones are, implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks. Not only is this wrongheaded but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks. By Mr. Trump s logic, after the huge financial crisis of , the best way to protect the American economy would have been to ban white males. According to reporting by Mother Jones, since , there have been mass shootings in this country, and more than half of those were perpetrated by white males. I doubt we ll hear Mr. Trump make a speech asking his fellow white males to tell authorities who the bad ones are, or call for restricting white males freedoms. One way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear Keep military grade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people, those with a history of violence, and those on F.B.I. watch lists. But, despite sit ins and filibusters, our lawmakers are failing us on this front and choose instead to side with the National Rifle Association. Suspected terrorists can buy assault rifles, but we re still carrying tiny bottles of shampoo to the airport. If we re going to use the they ll just find another way argument, let s use that to let us keep our shoes on. Xenophobic rhetoric was central to Mr. Trump s campaign long before the attack in Orlando. This is a guy who kicked off his presidential run by calling Mexicans rapists who were bringing drugs to this country. Numerous times, he has said that Muslims in New Jersey were cheering in the streets on Sept. , . This has been continually disproved, but he stands by it. I don t know what every Muslim American was doing that day, but I can tell you what my family was doing. I was studying at N.Y.U., and I lived near the World Trade Center. When the second plane hit, I was on the phone with my mother, who called to tell me to leave my dorm building. The haunting sound of the second plane hitting the towers is forever ingrained in my head. My building was close enough that it shook upon impact. I was scared for my life as my fellow students and I trekked the panicked streets of Manhattan. My family, unable to reach me on my cellphone, was terrified about my safety as they watched the towers collapse. There was absolutely no cheering. Only sadness, horror and fear. Mr. Trump, in response to the attack in Orlando, began a tweet with these words Appreciate the congrats. It appears that day he was the one who was celebrating after an attack. ",

        "text": " CNN The Democratic National Convention kicked off Monday without its outgoing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, following a chaotic scene at a morning meeting where she was loudly jeered by Bernie Sanders supporters. I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention, Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in an interview. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake, who is also the Democratic National Committee s secretary, handled the gaveling instead. Delegates, alternatives, standing committee members and all of our honored Democrats and other guests here in Philadelphia and all of you who have joined us by television, radio and online, here in the United States and around the world, she said, I hereby call the th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order. From Russia without love? DNC hack roils Philly Wasserman Schultz will also not speak tonight or throughout the duration of the convention, a Democrat close to her says. She will remain in Philadelphia until Friday when she formally steps down as leader of the committee. Wasserman Schultz changed her plans as the fallout deepened from leaked DNC emails that appeared to show the committee favoring presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders during the primary. It became clear Monday that the convention floor could erupt in anger if she gaveled the convention into session or sought to speak. And the Democratic National Committee issued an apology to Sanders moments after the convention opened, likely hoping to help soothe tensions heading into the week. On behalf of everyone at the DNC, we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen. Sanders, his supporters, and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email, the statement said. These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process. The DNC does not and will not tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates. Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments, and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again. The morning Florida delegate meeting descended into chaos when Wasserman Schultz took the stage, with critics holding up signs with the word emails, and Sanders supporters booing the congresswoman loudly, even after she began speaking. We have to make sure that we move forward together in a unified way, Wasserman Schultz said during brief remarks. We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, we know that is not the Florida that we know. The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to make jobs. The audience was roughly half supportive of Wasserman Schultz and half detractors, though the angry participants were louder than the other half. Those attendees began to chant, Shame! Shame! Shame! while Wasserman Schultz was speaking. Sanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech Monday. We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine, Sanders said, which prompted some attendees to shout him down. Sanders booed after voicing support for Clinton Sanders booed after voicing support for Clinton Alternate plans Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she is stepping down as chairwoman of the DNC at the end of the party s convention. The drama reinforced concerns about Democratic party unity. Former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver tried to show a unified Democratic Party on Monday, the morning after Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation. This happened, we knew it happened then, now is the time to go forward, Weaver told CNN s Chris Cuomo on New Day on Monday. Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump. Wasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation, a Democratic source said. Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals which include electing Clinton president is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention, Wasserman Schultz said in the statement. As party chair, this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats, but for all Americans, she said. Sanders campaign manager We must elect Clinton Sanders campaign manager We must elect Clinton DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election. She had been a CNN political commentator, but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract, effective immediately, although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity, CNN said. CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her role. Separately, a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm, among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned. Chants of Debbie is done! and Debbie resigned! broke out at a pro Sanders rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced. Party officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week. The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep. Marcia Fudge, D Ohio, as permanent chair of the convention, according to a DNC source. She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed. She s been quarantined, another top Democrat said of Wasserman Schultz, following a meeting Saturday night but before her announcement that she was leaving. Both sides of the aisle react Obama issued a statement, saying, For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful. And Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the party. I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership, Clinton said. After slamming Wasserman Schultz as highly overrated, Trump, speaking at a rally in Roanoke, Virginia, knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soon to be former DNC chair. How about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton. Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton, Trump said. These politicians. There s no loyalty there. No loyalty. None whatsoever. It gets a little heat and they fire her, Trump said. Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn t take more than five minutes to make that decision. Wasserman s Republican counterpart, Reince Priebus, said, I think the day s events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this week. The extreme left will not be satisfied by one person s resignation, the Republican party national chairman added. Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the door. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC s email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign, he said in a statement. Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz s lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret, classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad. DNC hack What you need to know Weaver called Wasserman Schultz s departure a win on CNN s Erin Burnett OutFront on Sunday. I think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard, he said. And other people, frankly, in the party, Hillary Clinton supporters, who felt this was the last straw, that she had to go, and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November united to deal with the problem of Donald Trump. Wasserman Schultz s stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process, but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly , emails. One email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters. Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement. Sanders No question DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton Sanders No question DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton Before the announcement, Sanders on Sunday told Tapper the release of the DNC emails that show its staffers working against him underscores the position he s held for months Wasserman Schultz needs to go. I don t think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC, not only for these awful emails, which revealed the prejudice of the DNC, but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people, and I don t think her leadership style is doing that, Sanders told Tapper on State of the Union, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. I am not an atheist, he said. But aside from all of that, it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates to be fair and even minded. He added But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me. ",

You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them, it s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. Mr. Bush and the bus toadies laugh. You can t do anything, actually. This might be a challenging concept for someone running a campaign so socially retrograde it s practically medieval, but women are allowed to own property now. That includes our own bodies, whether you feel automatically entitled to pieces of us or not. Every woman knows a version of Donald Trump. Most of us have known more of them than we can or care to recall. He s the boss who thinks you owe him something the date who thinks that silence means yes and no means try harder the stranger who thinks your body s mere existence constitutes an invitation to touch, take, own and destroy. He s every deadbeat hookup, every narcissistic loser, every man who s ever tried to leverage power, money, fame, credibility or physical strength to snap your boundaries like matchsticks. He is hot fear and cold dread and a pit in your stomach. He s the man who held you back, who never took you seriously, who treated you like nothing until you started to believe it, who raped you and told you it was your fault and whose daddy was a cop so who would believe you anyway? Come on, women. You know this man. I can name the ones in my past name yours and imagine each as president, with every woman s life in his care. Would you even trust him to watch your dog? That s a trick question because he would never do it. His defining characteristic is that he does not care about you. When Mr. Trump tells Mr. Bush that he s gotta use a Tic Tac just in case he cannot restrain himself from non consensually affixing his perfectly round, gasping lamprey mouth over Ms. Zucker s, he is talking about sexually assaulting a co worker. When he says he grabs women s genitals, he is talking about sexually assaulting anyone he feels like, at any time. Female Trump voters It s fine if you ve come to terms with not being a full human being in the eyes of your party, but what about your daughters? Is that the life you want for them? You want old men to grab their genitals? You want the president of the United States to go around grabbing genitals? Mr. Trump is rape culture s blathering id, and Sunday night Hillary Clinton who, no doubt, has just as many man made scars as the rest of us has to stand next to him on a stage, and remain unflappable as she s held to an astronomically higher standard, and pretend that he is her equal while his followers persist in howling that sexism is a feminist myth. While Mr. Trump boasts about sexual assault and vows to suppress disobedient media, cable news pundits spend their time taking a protractor to Mrs. Clinton s smile a constant, churning, microanalysis of nothing. Many people, well, many men, are expressing their disgust with Mr. Trump the only way they know how By invoking their mothers and daughters and sisters people, presumably, with the anatomy Mr. Trump feels free to assess and knead. Hillary Clinton has been showing us all year, and all her life, that, sure, women can be cherished if you want, but they also can be president. Meanwhile, right wing lawmakers are scrambling, sanctimonious and pathetic, to distance themselves from their own hideous progeny, clearly hoping to salvage some personal credibility and perhaps even save their party. But here is the thing, the big thing, that Paul D. Ryan and Reince Priebus and Mike Pence and all the spineless Billy Bushes of the world and plenty of progressive men too, for that matter don t understand Most of you are no better than Mr. Trump you are just more subtle. If you have spent your career brutalizing and dehumanizing women legislatively rather than personally, you are no better. If you were happy to overlook months of violent racism, xenophobia, transphobia and Islamophobia from the Trump campaign, but now you re mad that he used a bad word and tried to sleep with another man s wife, you are no better. If you have derided and stigmatized identity politics in an effort to keep the marginalized from organizing, you are no better. If you snicker or say nothing while your fellow men behave like Donald Trump, you are no better. The truth is that all of you have failed women for generations, and you deserve to lose our votes. Next month we will grab you where it hurts. By your ballots.",

        "text": "I like authenticity, especially as compared to survey tested or heavily spun. I am prepared to let a candidate say something that I don t completely agree with and still support him or her. I think the need to be politically correct has gone too far. I also think the media often hypes and slants stories to the point of being untruthful. I think a prosperous middle class is the key to the American success story, both economically and politically, and that lobbyists have way too much sway. I am very much a pragmatist, so much so that I like compromise more than I like ideology. I like deals, especially those that are win win. So Donald Trump is my candidate, right? He is NOT! In , when I was years old and he was , Donald Trump hired me to be his attorney on a major northern New Jersey project, a shopping center, which like everything else, was to bear his name, Trump Centre. It was a big deal that he picked me and a high honor for me just a couple of years after I started my law firm, which is now over years old. This was at a time when Trump still built things, having recently finished Trump Tower. I ll never forget when my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me. He seemed to me smart, business savvy, decisive. He had a very impressive office, a fancy and very big boat, an airline, a helicopter shuttle and several casinos. Within a few years, virtually all of this would be lost because of bad business decisions. Lots of lawyers have worked for Donald Trump lots and lots. I am no Roy Cohn ? neither as aggressive nor hopefully nearly as ethically challenged ? but I did know well how to get very tough land use matters through an always challenging application process in New Jersey. I was thrilled when he hired me. After the initial interview, my client contact with Donald was actually not very much. One low point I do remember actually will never forget is a limousine ride to a meeting with the editorial board of a New Jersey newspaper in which my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me. I was just plain shocked and embarrassed, but I kept smiling. I wanted and needed this client happy. While I was working for Donald, various press reports had Trump and his then wife Ivanna living in a personal apartment in the Trump Tower of , and even or rooms. Genuinely curious, I once asked him how many rooms the apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me However many they will print. Donald Trump was then, as he is now, larger than life, particularly in his own eyes, and at the same time frighteningly small, with very little moral grounding. He was then, and still is, all ego and show. I once asked him how many rooms his apartment actually had. I will never forget his response to me However many they will print. I have thought about this a lot, and I want to share my humble insights of why we cannot elect Donald Trump as president of the United States. To me, it is more about character than politics. Because of lack of the former, the latter ? the actual politics of Donald Trump ? are not that easy to discern. Once I got going with my reasons why Donald would not be good for our country, it was hard to stop. I did stop, however, when I hit , about , words from here. Read on if you are interested. . The man lies all the time. Like the skilled liar he is, he does it with impunity. I watched in Jersey City, NJ when thousands and thousands of people were cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed. The last quarter the gross domestic product was less than zero. The number of illegal immigrants in the United States is million, it could be million. The Mexican government forces bad people into our country. The unemployment rate may be as high as percent. All these things have been said by Donald, actually often yelled by him, and many times over and over in front of large crowds. How about the whopper, Crime statistics show blacks kill percent of white homicide victims ? One has to wonder why this lie would be conceived, much less told. Donald Trump says all of these things forcefully, so they must be true. But they are not! Unambiguously, they are what is described as pants on fire untruthful, as in, not a shred of truth. In passing, you have to ponder whether yet another of Donald Trump s oft made statements about the fervor of his Christianity and the Bible being his favorite book are also not grounded in truth. Clearly, thou shall not lie is not his favorite of the Ten Commandments. . It is actually not all about the candidate. It s amazing how often I am right? I alone can fix this. I have a big brain. I advise myself. I am very, very rich. Donald really said all these things. His ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control. He fusses, he fumes, and he says unbelievably inappropriate things. He is in his glory when he can bully his way to a result he covets. His ego seems to know no bounds. When Donald feels insulted by someone, he obsesses without control. Did you ever notice that those real people stories other candidates are always telling about someone they just met, struggling with a difficult problem, are just not in the Trump lexicon? He keeps telling us he is all about winners. I guess these folks don t qualify. Said another way, Donald Trump doesn t play well in the sandbox with others. First, he has his own ideas as to who can be in the sandbox with him. He also wants to run the sandbox. He is the kid who gets his way or stomps off in a huff. What happens when he figures out, even our nation s highest office is not all about him? Do we want him with the codes to nuclear weapons? . U.S. presidents are by design not kings. The Constitution makes them share power. Donald Trump who uses the I word more than anyone who has ever aspired to the job, has a brazenly authoritarian bent. He wants to be a strongman, not a president. One has to wonder what would happen if he actually had to govern or make one of his deals in a zero sum world of politics where the other side just says no. What then of his notoriously short attention span, temper or non stop need to tweet his every frustration? . The devil IS in the details. JONATHAN DRAKE REUTERS Donald Trump holds a sign supporting his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico that he borrowed from a member of the audience at his campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina March , . Winning so much we will get tired of winning, Make good deals with China, or even Make America great again are slogans that don t actually say anything. We are not stupid share some details with us, so we can figure out whether you know what you are talking about. For Donald, however, in the few instances when specifics do follow, like perhaps the , mile, foot wall or the deportation of million immigrants, the details never come. Never are we told that to build the wall, even to the lower feet, by actual construction estimates would cost billion dollars, even if you could get the land to build it most of the border Trump wants to wall is in the middle of a river and land in many cases could not even be secured for a fence . His magic to make Mexico pay for it? The only suggestion I have heard is take it out of remittances from folks mailing money back home or one of his percent tariffs. How is that going to work for the Americans sending the money to relatives or all of us paying percent more for Mexican made merchandise or the American company doing the manufacturing? How about the fact that the wall would do little to stop illegal immigration, more of which is overstays of visitors than over the border and likely will generate few, if any, jobs for the folks Trump has whipped up into a xenophobic frenzy. Then let s take the deportation and just focus on the big stuff. How exactly do you round up and deport million people? Is he going to use stadiums and nationalize cruise ship lines? Who will be doing the rounding up, certainly not the police, the army perhaps? The children left behind? How about the fact that American farms, restaurants, not to mention landscaping and construction labor jobs will go unattended? Vital jobs for sure, but are these the jobs that Trump plans to provide for his real Americans to make America great again? . Words matter. Everything is not a disaster, stupid or a disgrace. Neither is it tremendous, huge, fantastic or amazing. Everyone is not a loser, low energy or a bimbo. Talk of former presidents being liars ? or his favorite, a disaster ? and foreign dictators being great leaders does not advance the discourse. Americans are mostly not prudes, but vulgarity from the dais, penis size allusions, reveling in sexual conquests, menstruation based criticism and crass insults of every shape and form just does not cut it from a president. We have children. . Reading is good. So is studying. Donald Trump recently told us that he does not read much. We know from the recent revelations by Tony Schwartz, his ghost writer on The Art of the Deal yes, I do have my copy from when it first came out, autographed with Donald telling me to keep up the great work , which Donald says is second only to the Bible as the must read book, that he certainly has not written a book ? at least not that one. It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job. Even though for many years I owned a bookstore and would not let my kids watch TV on weekdays to help them become readers, I do not believe you must read to lead. I do believe, however, that those who seek to lead us need to study hard, seek to gain wisdom from others, and try to master very complex ideas and relationships. I think being president is hard. I am glad that after a long day, President Obama retreats to his private study almost every night for or hours of quiet study... and reading. Any fair interpretation of Trump s many bizarre statements and flip flops makes it clear he has not the slightest inclination to read or study. In his own words, he makes decisions with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I already had, plus the words common sense, because I have lots of common sense and I have a lot of business ability. It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job. . The new vocabulary we are adjusting to is not a good one. Xenophobe intense dislike or fear of people from foreign countries misogynist strong prejudice against women nativist preference for established inhabitants as opposed to immigrants fascist authoritarian and dictatorial bigot intolerance for those with a different opinion demagogue inflaming passions based on popular desires not on rationale arguments dystopian describing a place, typically totalitarian, where everything is unpleasant and squalid racist oh, you know what this one is . We have all had to get the dictionary out to understand many of the not household terms that had to find their way into print to describe the unique phenomenon that is Donald Trump. The scary thing is that these strange words are at least close to the mark. What happened to statesmanlike, well qualified, or even brilliant, as words we can use to describe people we want to elect to high office? Haven t heard any of these associated with the Donald. . We need to be careful with tough. Donald Trump said of a protester at one of his rallies, in the good old days they would have carried him out on a stretcher. His world reveres this brand of toughness. This toughness is not about the strength it takes to use restraint or to make really hard decisions. It is about punching that guy in the face, or at a minimum, saving face ? his. I will resist the temptation to belabor the nuclear codes point again, and rather just query do we really want a thin skinned president who, as he suggested, if a government leader Castro was not on the tarmac to meet his plane, would turn around Air Force One and come home. Or one who when confronted with the fact that whether or not his careless re tweet of a white supremacist created Jewish star and dollar bill backed attack of Hillary Clinton was anti Semitic, can t even just give one of those non apology apologies, I am sorry if I offended anyone. A tough guy who instead declares major newscasters stupid and sick and makes it all about the media who dare to criticize him, with never a word to David Duke and the ugly element high fiving him and resending his initial offensive post. Whether or not the post was intended to even more firmly entrench this segment of support, Trump demonstrates his version of tough, one that glorifies his opinion and his being right over all else. Nowhere in his world can tough be humble, respectful, restrained or diplomatic. . Success does matter. Donald Trump s business success is greatly exaggerated and his skills limited. Donald Trump is a great salesman and a showman promoter in a league only with PT Barnum. This we can give him. He has also been very good at making his name a brand and selling its use. For a while, he had some pretty high TV ratings by telling out of work celebrities they were fired. However, even in his own playing field, ask any large New York real estate developer, of which surprise, surprise he is not one, at least not as to large th in New York City on the latest list , and you will learn his successes are few. Four business bankruptcies , , and , the Plaza Hotel, Trump Air, all three casinos a couple times the steaks, the water, Trump Centre in New Jersey that I worked on, Manhattan s West Side rail yards where buildings do bear his name as a consolation , the much hyped , get rich scheme Trump University ? all failures by any measure except of course to Donald, who has no regrets, whatsoever. Then there are basic business ethics , lawsuits, the fact that he has penchant for not paying bills fully or on time, or that he calls himself the King of Debt ? a king made rich by running up debt, then renegotiating it. Is this the skill set we want for the president? Even with Trump s fabled net worth, always exaggerated by billions more than others calculate, one has to wonder if his true net worth wouldn t be just as much if he took his considerable inheritance from father Fred and just passively invested it. We ll never know from Donald ? certainly not from those tax returns he won t release. . We could not be the great country we are without the First Amendment, but our media may kill us. The media is not Donald s enemy as he keeps announcing from the stage. It may be the enemy of the rest of us, however. It sure feels like it lately. The air time Donald gets, and his ability to phone in his rants especially with the cable media is nothing short of, to use one of his words, disgusting. Donald, who lives by polls and ratings, understands it is ratings and not news worthiness that dictates what is on the airwaves. Donald dominates almost every news cycle, simply by being more outrageous than anyone or anything else. The false equivalency created by point counterpoint talking heads then makes over the top positions seem legitimate. It is reality TV writ large and it is very out of control. . Temperament, demeanor and character are important. In many ways, Donald represents the very worst in all of us, or at least many of us. He is all about continuous gratification. He is the petulant child who wants his way. He is the selfish teenager with no big picture yet. He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race and religion, education, good looks, and family fortune to succeed easily, and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not. He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race ... and family fortune to succeed easily and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not. He is a man who thinks it is okay to call someone fat or ugly or stupid or to make fun of a person with a disability. He is the collector of trophy wives and trophy properties, the guy who wins, or so he thinks, because he has the most toys. . The emperor and his clothes. Donald says he knows more about the military than anyone else. Why? Because he went to an expensive prep school where they wore uniforms and sometimes marched? How about, I know more about ISIS than the generals. Please, can some real soldiers evaluate this? Donald says America never wins anymore. Compared to whom, and at what? No doubt we have problems. Democracy is messy. Witness the present campaign, and the long slow recovery from the recession has not included the middle class nearly enough. And, yes, trade in a world that is now fully connected and integrated is hard to figure out. But by what measure is America, as Donald tells us, a disaster ? How do you actually say and believe, This country is a hell hole. We are going down fast. Compared to whom? Mexico, China or his most bizarre new favorite, Russia, that he tells us beat us all the time ... because our leaders are stupid ? Give us a break. . Sophomoric speech tricks don t work ? at least not with most of us. Says Donald, I am not going to talk about the libertarian VP candidate s alcoholism. I refuse to say... I cannot stand to say... that I cannot stand the sound of Clinton screaming into the microphone all the time. You just did, Donald. We get it that with these statements, even you know you are on shaky ground so you are trying to play it both ways. Doesn t work. Nor does your even more insidious, not so clever trick of attributing to others wild accusations that even you are afraid to make, but that you want to advance. How about when discussing the Orlando massacre, there are a lot of people that think President Obama doesn t want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesn t want to know about it I happen to think he just doesn t know what he is doing, but there are many people that think maybe he just doesn t want to get it. He doesn t want to see what s really happening. And that could be. Who are these people who have placed the president on the side of the terrorists? Perhaps the same people who, with Trump, saw the masses in New Jersey celebrating the destruction of the twin towers, or those convinced Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster, that Ted Cruz s father was working with Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy, or that President Obama was not born in the United States nor did he graduate from Harvard or Columbia. Two possibilities. The likely one lots of people are saying is just Trump code for I want to now float something so outrageous even red faced Donald can t get it out without this qualifier. Or perhaps the lots of people is a select group, the closed loop of the loyalists who attend his rallies that heard it from him! . A thin skin does not work for a president. The politicians have again chosen this presidential pigmy as their nominee. So said the long defunct New York Herald about Abraham Lincoln, now nearly everybody s choice for our nation s best president. Consider the statement when George Washington left office the time is now arrived for the source of all misfortune of our country to be reduced to a level with his fellow citizens. U.S. presidents, all of them, have had their critics, and in our land of wonderful free speech, the critics get to have their say. Thank goodness. That Donald does not do well with criticism is not really open to debate. Ask Megyn Kelly third rate talent , Rosie O Donnell nice little fat Rosie, total loser or Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas or for that matter virtually any of his recently vanquished adversaries Cruz, Kasich, Rubio or Bush, in just the first tier. Even the one most like him now apparently looking for a post New Jersey job with him , Chris Christie felt his sting when he suggested Donald was thin skinned. He just can t let anything go ever. He obsesses even when he wins. Republicans who broke the pledge to support him, they should not be allowed to run for office again. In Donald s world, disagreeing with him has to have a consequence ? a serious one ? and pursuing this goal is worthy of effort and energy, even when it makes no difference. Do we really think our president has time for this? Do we really want a man with such sensibilities and such an authoritarian bent in charge of, say, the FBI or the IRS? Does the concept of secret police, a favorite of leaders of this type elsewhere, seem too extreme? Probably, yes. But if I was Donald, I would float it with one of his people are saying declarations. There, I just used his trick. See how easy it is. . Bullies will always exist somewhere, but the White House should not be that somewhere. What does a bully do? Most of all he or she seeks to intimidate, physically or at least verbally. So far this character trait of Donald s has been exclusively verbal and aimed at business adversaries and more recently politicians and journalists ? and, of course, then ex ghost writer of his book and ex employees or contractors he cheated those who do not have anti disparagement contractual handcuffs who dare to candidly assess his conduct. What happens when this guy gets the world s strongest army at his disposal, and a bully pulpit that guarantees him notice? Seem like a bad idea to anyone else? . Law and order. Before it was an Emmy winning TV show, law and order was a campaign theme used by Richard Nixon in to get himself elected in a year when our country had two very public assassinations and destructive demonstrations, even riots, in U.S. cities. Nixon sought to mobilize what he called the silent majority around the need for more police. He also tapped into the racial and economic divide between black and white and working class and elite Eastern liberals, and the evil media that his vice president, Spiro Agnew, called nattering nabobs of negativism. Is Donald Trump seeking to bring this back? Of course yes, yet no. Yes, he wants to separate and mobilize angry voters who feel left behind by an increasingly diverse culture. No, because his dystopian version of lawless, besieged, pitifully weak America is not what Nixon preached, nor for that matter Ronald Reagan. It is unique to him, at least in our country. It is, however, a textbook version of the rallying cry of countless dictators and strongmen. It is a demagogue s basic tool, to gin up a problem then declare he is the only one who can fix it. As bad as all this rhetoric is, what next? He tells us, On January , , the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced... crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon?I mean very soon?come to an end. How s this work, Donald? Martial law? Does he honestly believe President Obama, and for that matter all of his predecessors, would not have liked to have all laws effective and fully followed? If only wishing could make it so! However, since the states, not the federal government, hold sway over most criminal law, the president acting alone has no Constitutional power to do any such thing. What then? More of the water boarding and killing families of terrorists logic? I alone can fix it! . Incoherent rants, often contradictory, does not a foreign policy make. Convince Japan and South Korea to seek nuclear arms. Eliminate NATO. Crush ISIS but do it without Muslim allies and no troops on the ground. Sometimes attack Libya, sometimes not. Sometimes attack surgically, but don t let it come out the way it did. Sometimes it s good we attacked Iraq, sometimes not. Do not nation build, but fix Syria. Stop Iran by making better deals. In fact, come to think of it, that is the solution to almost everything just make better deals everywhere. Oh, yes and never apologize for anything. We are America, very, very rich and beholden to no one. Like us or else. Sound like someone we know? . How will anyone effectively be president if we don t at least respect the office? In the s during an unpopular war, we all endured a president adorning himself with a flag pin and declaring anyone who did not agree with him which include a heck of a lot of young people on campuses all across America, including me somehow un American. Although political opposition is as old as our nation, we begin to slide down the slope of dangerous disrespect when disagreement is replaced with vilification. This Republican nominee for the presidency thinks it is okay to accuse a former president of his own party of intentionally going to war on false pretenses and the current President of being in conspiracy with Muslim terrorists. Any thoughtful American of either party or no party, of any political philosophy must see that this must stop. Truth, or at least a semblance of some, has to come back. Outrageous lies just have no place in meaningful discourse ? outrageous liars even less so. They cannot become the backbone of a point counterpoint talking head media circus that is so much more about ratings than truth. . Rich and powerful guys have to play by the rules, too. Let s not kid ourselves. Trump University was not an academic institution, far from it. It was a get rich quick scheme by a guy selling a get rich quick scheme. It is not the first or the last of its type. Late night, cheap advertising time television will always feature this fare. Donald s efforts, however, were on so much a grander scale ? , ... a university. Really? What this was is an out and out fraud scheme by a man now trying to become the leader of our country and the free world. We all know, or at least have read, that suckers are born every minute. But can t we at least disrespect those who prey on these poor folks, and when they really go too far, sue them? No, says Donald Trump. The court case brought by a whole class of plaintiffs against his scam is only still in court, Donald says, because the long time and distinguished federal judge is a hater not capable of giving him justice because his parents are from Mexico. In Donald s world, the only individual capable of judging him would not be Mexican or related to anyone from Mexico, likewise folks of the Muslim faith, and, oh yeah, likewise women. In this world rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically challenged older white men should then only be judged by rich, entitled, egotistical, ethically challenged older white men. . We must stand for something. Donald Trump s version of America does not include folks not like him. Instead, he is all about what Sarah Palin labeled real Americans. The fact that all us others seem to be utterly expendable is deeply troubling. Targeting an entire religion ? Islam, with . billion adherents, . million being U.S. citizens ? for extra scrutiny or worse is patently inconsistent with traditional American values, if not those of the real Americans. It is also unconstitutional, and, beyond all this, incredibly counterproductive as it hardens the lines of controversy by wholesale moving of the allies we need to solve terrorist problems into the enemy camp. Other similar strategies championed by Donald, like waterboarding and other forms of torture, not to mention targeting families of an enemy, are not just illegal. They are, to use another one of his words, stupid . They do not work, very likely making situations worse and our enemies more numerous and passionate. One has to wonder, what does the America of the real Americans look like? A bunch of intolerant, hyper aggressive, folks behind a big wall, isolated not trading with anyone and thus with a sick economy and very expensive goods and with a lot of enemies. No Shining City on the Hill, for sure. Hard to see anything but ruin ahead for such a place. We can do so much better! For me, better comes easily in the form of former Senator and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. For those who do not come to that conclusion easily I get it , this year it will have to be the lesser of two evils. No matter what, don t even think about taking us into the abyss that is Donald Trump. ",

        "text": "Don t expect to see Donald Trump give a humble concession speech if he loses the Republican presidential nomination. During a Sunday rally in Maryland, the Republican presidential frontrunner mocked candidates who praise their opponents during concession speeches, saying that if he loses the contest, Americans will probably not hear much from him again. They fight like hell for six months, and they re saying horrible things, the worst things you can imagine, Trump said. And then one of them loses, one of them wins. And the one who loses says, I just want to congratulate my opponent. He is a brilliant man, he ll be a great governor or president or whatever. He continued I m not sure you re ever going to see me there. I don t think I m going to lose, but if I do, I don t think you re ever going to see me again, folks. I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something. Trump s mockery wasn t relegated just to the electoral losers. He also said Sunday that the winners were too modest. Half the times the winners put them in the administration that s how they get rid of them, Trump said of the losing candidates. This line of thought has not stopped Trump from graciously accepting endorsements from other candidates who have dropped out of the presidential race. Trump frequently touts his support from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. During a news conference in February announcing Christie s endorsement, Trump lauded Christie s tenure as a governor and his barbs during the Republican presidential debates. Generally speaking, I m not big on endorsements, Trump said, adding, This was an endorsement that really meant a lot. ",

        "text": "DONALD J. TRUMP, until now a Republican problem, this week became a challenge the nation must confront and overcome. The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president, in experience and temperament. He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer, not substance. To the extent he has views, they are wrong in their diagnosis of America s problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions. Mr. Trump s politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together. His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nation s two century old experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knew. Any one of these characteristics would be disqualifying together, they make Mr. Trump a peril. We recognize that this is not the usual moment to make such a statement. In an ordinary election year, we would acknowledge the Republican nominee, move on to the Democratic convention and spend the following months, like other voters, evaluating the candidates performance in debates, on the stump and in position papers. This year we will follow the campaign as always, offering honest views on all the candidates. But we cannot salute the Republican nominee or pretend that we might endorse him this fall. A Trump presidency would be dangerous for the nation and the world. Why are we so sure? Start with experience. It has been years since a major party nominated anyone for president who did not have electoral experience. That experiment turned out pretty well but Mr. Trump, to put it mildly, is no Dwight David Eisenhower. Leading the Allied campaign to liberate Europe from the Nazis required strategic and political skills of the first order, and Eisenhower though he liked to emphasize his common touch as he faced the intellectual Democrat Adlai Stevenson was shrewd, diligent, humble and thoughtful. In contrast, there is nothing on Mr. Trump s r sum to suggest he could function successfully in Washington. He was staked in the family business by a well to do father and has pursued a career marked by some real estate successes, some failures and repeated episodes of saving his own hide while harming people who trusted him. Given his continuing refusal to release his tax returns, breaking with a long bipartisan tradition, it is only reasonable to assume there are aspects of his record even more discreditable than what we know. The lack of experience might be overcome if Mr. Trump saw it as a handicap worth overcoming. But he displays no curiosity, reads no books and appears to believe he needs no advice. In fact, what makes Mr. Trump so unusual is his combination of extreme neediness and unbridled arrogance. He is desperate for affirmation but contemptuous of other views. He also is contemptuous of fact. Throughout the campaign, he has unspooled one lie after another that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after , that his tax cut plan would not worsen the deficit, that he opposed the Iraq War before it started and when confronted with contrary evidence, he simply repeats the lie. It is impossible to know whether he convinces himself of his own untruths or knows that he is wrong and does not care. It is also difficult to know which trait would be more frightening in a commander in chief. Given his ignorance, it is perhaps not surprising that Mr. Trump offers no coherence when it comes to policy. In years past, he supported immigration reform, gun control and legal abortion as candidate, he became a hard line opponent of all three. Even in the course of the campaign, he has flip flopped on issues such as whether Muslims should be banned from entering the United States and whether women who have abortions should be punished . Worse than the flip flops is the absence of any substance in his agenda. Existing trade deals are stupid, but Mr. Trump does not say how they could be improved. The Islamic State must be destroyed, but the candidate offers no strategy for doing so. Eleven million undocumented immigrants must be deported, but Mr. Trump does not tell us how he would accomplish this legally or practically. What the candidate does offer is a series of prejudices and gut feelings, most of them erroneous. Allies are taking advantage of the United States. Immigrants are committing crimes and stealing jobs. Muslims hate America. In fact, Japan and South Korea are major contributors to an alliance that has preserved a peace of enormous benefit to Americans. Immigrants commit fewer crimes than native born Americans and take jobs that no one else will. Muslims are the primary victims of Islamist terrorism, and Muslim Americans, including thousands who have served in the military, are as patriotic as anyone else. Fareed Zakaria America would be Trump s banana republic The Trump litany of victimization has resonated with many Americans whose economic prospects have stagnated. They deserve a serious champion, and the challenges of inequality and slow wage growth deserve a serious response. But Mr. Trump has nothing positive to offer, only scapegoats and dark conspiracy theories. He launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists across the border, and similar hatefulness has surfaced numerous times in the year since. In a dangerous world, Mr. Trump speaks blithely of abandoning NATO, encouraging more nations to obtain nuclear weapons and cozying up to dictators who in fact wish the United States nothing but harm. For eight years, Republicans have criticized President Obama for apologizing for America and for weakening alliances. Now they put forward a candidate who mimics the vilest propaganda of authoritarian adversaries about how terrible the United States is and how unfit it is to lecture others. He has made clear that he would drop allies without a second thought. The consequences to global security could be disastrous. Most alarming is Mr. Trump s contempt for the Constitution and the unwritten democratic norms upon which our system depends. He doesn t know what is in the nation s founding document. When asked by a member of Congress about Article I, which enumerates congressional powers, the candidate responded, I am going to abide by the Constitution whether it s number , number , number , number . The charter has seven articles. Worse, he doesn t seem to care about its limitations on executive power. He has threatened that those who criticize him will suffer when he is president. He has vowed to torture suspected terrorists and bomb their innocent relatives, no matter the illegality of either act. He has vowed to constrict the independent press. He went after a judge whose rulings angered him, exacerbating his contempt for the independence of the judiciary by insisting that the judge should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump has encouraged and celebrated violence at his rallies. The U.S. democratic system is strong and has proved resilient when it has been tested before. We have faith in it. But to elect Mr. Trump would be to knowingly subject it to threat. Mr. Trump campaigns by insult and denigration, insinuation and wild accusation Ted Cruz s father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy Hillary Clinton may be guilty of murder Mr. Obama is a traitor who wants Muslims to attack. The Republican Party has moved the lunatic fringe onto center stage, with discourse that renders impossible the kind of substantive debate upon which any civil democracy depends. Most responsible Republican leaders know all this to be true that is why Mr. Trump had to rely so heavily on testimonials by relatives and employees during this week s Republican convention. With one exception Bob Dole , the living Republican presidents and presidential nominees of the past three decades all stayed away. But most current officeholders, even those who declared Mr. Trump to be an unthinkable choice only months ago, have lost the courage to speak out. The party s failure of judgment leaves the nation s future where it belongs, in the hands of voters. Many Americans do not like either candidate this year . We have criticized the presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in the past and will do so again when warranted. But we do not believe that she or the Libertarian and Green party candidates, for that matter represents a threat to the Constitution. Mr. Trump is a unique and present danger.",

        "text": "Donald Trump is going to be elected president. The American people voted for him a long time ago. They voted for him when The History Channel went from showing documentaries about the Second World War to Pawn Stars and Swamp People. They voted for him when The Discovery Channel went from showing Lost Treasures of the Yangtze Valley to Naked and Afraid. They voted for him when The Learning Channel moved from something you could learn from to My lb Life. They voted for him when CBS went from airing Harvest of Shame to airing Big Brother. These networks didn t make these programming changes by accident. They were responding to what the American people actually wanted. And what they wanted was Naked and Afraid and Duck Dynasty. The polls may show that Donald Trump is losing to Hillary Clinton, but don t you believe those polls. When the AC Nielsen Company selects a new Nielsen family, they disregard the new family s results for the first three months. The reason when they feel they are being monitored, people lie about what they are watching. In the first three months, knowing they are being watched, they will tune into PBS. But over time they get tired of pretending. Then it is back to the Kardashians. The same goes for people who are being asked by pollsters for whom they are voting. They will not say Donald Trump. It is too embarrassing. But the truth is, they like Trump. He is just like their favorite shows on TV. Mindless entertainment. Trump s replacement of Paul Manafort with Breitbart s Steve Bannon shows that Trump understands how Americans actually think. They think TV. They think ratings. They think entertainment. We are a TV based culture. We have been for some time now. The average American spends hours a day, every day, watching TV. After sleep, it is our number one activity. More shockingly, we spend . hours a day staring at screens phones, tablets, computers. And more and more of the content on those devices is also video and TV. If you spend hours a day, every day, for years and years doing the same thing it has an impact on you. For the past years, we have devoted hours a day staring at a screen every day. And we haven t been watching Judy Woodruff. We have been watching reality TV shows. That is what we love. That is what we resonate to. The Real Housewives of Atlanta. The French may love food. The Italians may love opera. What we love is TV. We are TV culture. It defines who we are. In the s, early television was allowed, with many restrictions, to be an observational guest at political conventions. They were quiet flies on the wall, carefully and quietly commentating on what they saw way down below. They did not get involved in the process. Today, they ARE the process. Today, political conventions are nothing but carefully directed TV shows. Likewise debates. They exist only to entertain a TV audience. TV and entertainment now dictate everything political. It is a never ending show. The biggest reality show on air. And Donald Trump is great TV. He knows how to entertain. He understands ratings. Hillary Clinton is crap TV. She may be smarter, better prepared, a better politician. It won t matter. She is terrible entertainment. That s just how it is. Depressing, but true. He is Kim Kardashian. She is Judy Woodruff. Who gets better ratings? Who would you rather watch for the next four years? Honestly... In , the great French gastronom Brillat de Savarind said, Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are. Today, in America, we can safely say, Tell me what you watch, and I will tell you what you are. And what do we watch? It isn t PBS NewsHour. ",

        "text": "This is my last column until after the election, so I d like to address the people least likely to read it Donald Trump voters. Who knows? Maybe I ll get lucky and a few of them will buy fish wrapped in this column, and they ll accidentally peruse it! Desperate times call for desperate measures. While I ve opposed the Trump candidacy from the start, I ve never disparaged Trump voters. Some are friends and neighbors they re all fellow Americans. We should take their concerns seriously. But we should also demand that they be serious, that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidates. Yes, Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader but in the way so many presidents were. We know her flaws She has a weakness for secrecy, occasionally fudges truths, has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women. But she is not indecent, and that is an important distinction. And she s studious, has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriously. Trump is not only a flawed politician, he s an indecent human being. He s boasted of assaulting women prompting to come forward to testify that he did just that to them his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they weren t pretty enough. He s created a university that was charged with defrauding its students. He s been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties. He s stiffed countless vendors, from piano sellers to major contractors. He s refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that he s paid no federal taxes for years, is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesn t give like he says to charity. He s compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his sacrifice of building tall buildings. He s vowed, if elected, to prosecute his campaign rival. We have never seen such behaviors in a presidential candidate. At the same time, Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth. Harlan Coben s debate night tweet last month had it right On Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read. I understand why many Trump supporters have lost faith in Washington and want to just shake things up. When you shake things up with a studied plan and a clear idea of where you want to get to, you can open new futures. But when you shake things up, guided by one liners and no moral compass, you can cause enormous instability and systemic vertigo. Receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times s products and services. PRIVACY POLICY But there is an even more important reason Trump supporters, particularly less educated white males, should be wary of his bluster His policies won t help them. Trump promises to bring their jobs back. But most of their jobs didn t go to a Mexican. They went to a microchip. The idea that large numbers of manual factory jobs can be returned to America if we put up a wall with Mexico or renegotiate our trade deals is a fantasy. Trump ignores the fact that manufacturing is still by far the largest sector of the U.S. economy. Indeed, our factories now produce twice what they did in but with one third fewer workers. Trump can t change that. Machines and software will keep devouring, and spawning, more work of all kinds. Did you hear that IBM s cognitive computer, Watson, helped to create a pop song, Not Easy, with the Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid? The song was released on Oct. , IBM noted, and within hours it climbed to No. on iTunes s Hot Tracks. No one knows for certain how we deal with this new race with and against machines, but I can assure you it s not Trump s way build walls, restrict trade, give huge tax cuts to the rich. The best jobs in the future are going to be what I call STEMpathy jobs jobs that blend STEM skills science, technology, engineering, math with human empathy. We don t know what many of them will look like yet. The smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning, because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the world s most imaginative risk takers and strengthen our safety nets, because this era will leave more people behind. This is the only true path to American greatness in the st century. Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore. What do we have to lose by trying his way? Trump asks. The answer is everything that actually makes us great. When the world gets this fast, small errors in navigation have huge consequences. While Clinton has failed to inspire, her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course. And however great her flaws, she is still in the zone of human decency. Trump is not. We can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump. I pray that in the end at least some Trump voters, my fellow Americans, will see that.",

        "text": "Tonight, Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican Party s nomination for president of the United States. And I am, for the first time since I began covering American politics, genuinely afraid. Donald Trump is not a man who should be president. This is not an ideological judgment. This is not something I would say about Mitt Romney or Marco Rubio. This is not a disagreement over Donald Trump s tax plan or his climate policies. This is about Trump s character, his temperament, his impulsiveness, his basic decency. Back in February, I wrote that Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament he s a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he s also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it s hard to know if he even realizes he s lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash. He has had plenty of time to prove me, and everyone else, wrong. But he hasn t. He has not become more responsible or more sober, more decent or more generous, more considered or more informed, more careful or more kind. He has continued to retweet white supremacists, make racist comments, pick unnecessary fights, contradict himself on the stump, and show an almost gleeful disinterest in building a real campaign or learning about policy. He has, instead, run a campaign based on stoking fear and playing to resentment. His speech tonight invoked a nightmarish American hellscape that doesn t actually exist. His promise to restore order made him sound like the aspiring strongman his critics fear him to be. I have a message for all of you the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end, he said. Beginning on January th , safety will be restored. Here is what we know truly know about Trump. Here is why he should not be president. Trump is vindictive. So far, the unifying theme of Trump s convention is that the leader of the opposition party should be thrown in jail. Trump didn t like the Washington Post s coverage of his campaign, so he barred its reporters from his rallies and threatened to use the power of the presidency to bring an antitrust suit against the Post s owner, Jeff Bezos. He was upset that Ohio didn t vote for him, so he sat its delegation in the cheap seats, even though the state is hosting the convention. He was angry about an interview his ex ghostwriter gave to the New Yorker, so he sent his lawyers after him. He hates the protesters who interrupt his campaigns, so he said he would look into paying the legal fees of a supporter who sucker punched one of them. Imagine Donald Trump with the powers of the presidency. Imagine what he could do what he would do to those who crossed him. Trump is a bigot. Donald Trump kicked off his campaign calling Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists. He responded to Ted Cruz s surge in Iowa by calling for a ban on Muslim travel. He sought to discredit a US born judge by saying his rulings were suspect because of his Mexican heritage. Trump s campaign is certainly the first time in my memory that a sitting speaker of the House has had to describe something his party s nominee said as the textbook definition of a racist comment. This is not a man who should be put in charge of an increasingly diverse country that needs to find allies in an increasingly diverse world. Trump is a sexist. Stories of Trump s casual sexism abound, but during the campaign, it was women who questioned him who felt the full force of his misogyny. The first Republican debate, for instance, was hosted by Fox News and moderated by Megyn Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace. Kelly wasn t obviously tougher on Trump than her colleagues, but she was the antagonist he focused on, retweeting a follower who said she was a bimbo and saying she had blood coming out of her wherever. After Carly Fiorina challenged him in a debate, Trump said to Rolling Stone, Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president? After Hillary Clinton needed to take a bathroom break during a debate, Trump told the crowd, It s too disgusting. Don t say it, it s disgusting. It s not just during political campaigns that this side of Trump emerges. Trump once told his friend Philip Johnson that the secret to women was y ou have to treat em like shit. Trump is a liar. Trump boasts constantly that he had the judgment and foresight to oppose the Iraq War. But he didn t. On September , , Trump was asked by Howard Stern whether he supported the invasion of Iraq. Yeah, I guess so, he replied. Trump has not sought to explain these comments or offer evidence of an alternative judgment he offered elsewhere. He just lies about this, and he does so often. But that s true for Trump across many issues. He says his health care plan will insure everyone, when it will do nothing of the kind. He says his tax plan raises taxes on the wealthy when it actually cuts them sharply. Trump has lied about his net worth, his reasons for not releasing his tax returns, and his charitable donations. He lies easily, fluently, shamelessly, constantly. Trump is a narcissist. Trump s towering self regard worked for him as a real estate developer. His real business was licensing his name out for building, menswear, golf courses, steaks. A bit of a narcissism is necessary to become a global brand. But the trait is maladaptive in a presidential candidate. The most recent example was the minutes he spent talking about himself when he was supposed to be introducing Mike Pence, his vice presidential candidate, for the first time. The most grotesque example was when he responded to the deadliest mass shooting in American history by tweeting, Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism. Trump admires authoritarian dictators for their authoritarianism. When MSNBC s Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries, Trump replied, He s running his country, and at least he s a leader, unlike what we have in this country. But it s not just Putin. Trump has praised Saddam Hussein because he killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn t read them the rights. He said you ve got to give Kim Jong Un credit. He goes in, he takes over, and he s the boss. It s incredible. It s not just that Trump admires these authoritarians it s that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press, due process, and political opposition. Trump is a conspiracy theorist. Trump burst onto the scene as a leader of the absurd birther movement. He s said that Bill Ayers is the real author of Barack Obama s Dreams From My Father, explained that the unemployment rate in America is really over percent, and suggested that both Antonin Scalia and Vince Foster were murdered. Trump is very, very gullible. This is related to his conspiracy theories, but Trump has a habit of believing and retweeting bad information that sounds good to him at the time. This has led to, among other things, Trump retweeting false crime statistics, Trump retweeting Mussolini quotes from a Twitter account called Il Duce, Trump promoting a fake video claiming a protester who rushed his stage was sent by ISIS, and Trump endorsing a National Enquirer report suggesting Ted Cruz s dad helped kill JFK. When pressed about these sundry embarrassments, Trump said, All I know is what s on the internet. That s a reasonable response from your uncle who forwards you weird email chains, but not from a presidential candidate. Trump doesn t apologize, and his defensiveness escalates situations. On Monday night, it became very clear that Melania Trump s convention speech had lifted two paragraphs from Michelle Obama s convention speech. The error was an embarrassment, but it could have been dispatched quickly by simply admitting fault and apologizing. Instead, the Trump campaign turned it into a multi day story and a character issue by denying anything had happened and blaming Hillary Clinton. This is an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, how she seeks out to demean her and take her down, said campaign chair Paul Manafort, in one of the most genuinely ridiculous comments in recent American history. The campaign also tried to argue that Michelle Obama doesn t own the English language, and that similar language was used by Twilight Sparkle, a My Little Pony I m serious . Finally, days later, the Trump campaign admitted there was plagiarism and blamed a miscommunication between Melania and her speechwriter. A similar pattern played out when Trump tweeted an anti Hillary meme that superimposed a Star of David atop a pile of money and accused Clinton of corruption. The image was obviously anti Semitic, and the Trump campaign quickly took it down. But Trump himself went on a Twitter rampage, arguing that what was clearly a Star of David was actually just a sheriff s star, or maybe just a regular old star, and that the campaign shouldn t have removed the offending meme in the first place. So far, these examples are farce, but as Tim Lee writes, this tendency in the Oval Office could lead to tragedy Trump s behavior on the campaign trail suggests that he would be unlikely to admit mistakes and defuse tense situations. Instead, his first instinct would be to escalate every conflict in an effort to bully foreign adversaries into giving him his way. That might work in some cases. But in others especially against powerful countries like China or Russia the results could be disastrous. Trump surrounds himself with sycophants. It s tradition for presidential candidates to release a note from their physician testifying to their fitness to fulfill the duties of the presidency. On December , Donald Trump submitted his entry to this quadrennial custom. If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency, Dr. Harold Bornstein writes. His blood pressure, , and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent. His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary. This is not how most doctor notes read. Reached for comment regarding this, a spokesperson at the American Medical Association just giggled, reported the Daily Beast. There are many positions where one might accept a pliable crony. But personal physician should not be one of them. The fact that Trump would entrust his health to a doctor who would sign off on a note like this should terrify his family and friends. But more than that, it should disqualify him from the presidency. Trump has proven too lazy to learn about policy. Trump didn t know much about policy when the campaign started, and as far as anyone can tell, he hasn t made any obvious effort to rectify that. The latest and most damaging example is his interview with the New York Times, in which he said he would not automatically defend NATO countries against attack from Russia. It s not obvious Trump meant to say that, or even knew what saying that meant, as Manafort immediately began denying Trump had ever said it. The Times subsequently released a transcript showing that, yes, Trump had said it. But this is a pattern for Trump, who doesn t bother to come up with convincing answers even to obvious questions, and definitely has not put in the time to develop a deep understanding of the issues he might face as president. As Matt Yglesias wrote, this is very much a choice Trump has made. Trump is now the GOP nominee, and there are hundreds of professional Republican Party politicians and operatives around the country who would gladly help him become a sharper, better informed candidate. It doesn t happen because he can t be bothered. Trump has run an incompetent campaign and convention. As brilliant as Trump has been in securing media attention for himself and channeling the anxieties of conservative voters, he hasn t bothered to build a real campaign organization, and his convention has been a festival of unforced errors. This is the context of Melania Trump s plagiarism, of Ted Cruz s anti endorsement, of the night that was supposed to be about jobs and the economy but was actually about Benghazi and jailing Hillary Clinton. In isolation, these are gaffes, mistakes, bad luck. Together, though, they tell a damning story of organizational incompetence. The most generous interpretation of this is that Trump is capable of running an effective organization, but he s just not interested in conventions and field operations in the way he is interested in golf courses and condos. Others have certainly testified to the trouble Trump has focusing on tasks that don t engage him. His former ghostwriter says, He has no attention span. Unfortunately, the president actually needs to focus on all kinds of dull and unpleasant tasks. Trump is a bully. Trump won the Republican nomination by proving that even adults can be bullied with schoolyard taunts. There was low energy Jeb, and Little Marco, and Lyin Ted, and now we ve got Crooked Hillary. Trump made fun of Rand Paul s looks and Chris Christie s weight and Carly Fiorina s face and a New York Times reporter s physical disability. It seems like this shouldn t have to be said, but it s better to be kind than cruel, and there s a deep, instinctual cruelty in Trump he finds people s weak spots, their insecurities, and he exposes them in front of crowds. Trump has regularly incited or justified violence among his supporters. At a rally in St. Louis, Donald Trump lamented that nobody wants to hurt each other anymore. Yes, lamented. The topic was protesters, and Trump s frustration was clear. They re being politically correct the way they take them out, he sighed. Protesters, they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore. There used to be consequences. There are none anymore. Earlier in the campaign, two of Trump s supporters attacked a homeless Mexican man and told the police, Donald Trump was right all these illegals need to be deported. Trump s response? I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. The simple fact of it is that Donald Trump should not be president of the United States. That is not because he is too conservative, as some Democrats would have it, or because he is not conservative enough, as many Republicans would have it. It s because the presidency is a powerful job where mistakes can kill millions, and whoever holds it needs to take that power seriously and wield it responsibly. Trump has had ample opportunity to demonstrate his sense of seriousness and responsibility. He has failed. It is said that the benefit of America s long presidential campaigns is they offer the candidates time to show us who they really are. Trump has shown us who he really is. He is a person who should not be president. That he is being brought this close to the presidency that he is one major mistake by Hillary Clinton away from winning it should scare us all. It certainly scares me.",

        "text": "Conservatives efforts to recruit a candidate to compete against Donald Trump may have only been able to come up with David French, a National Review writer, who is merely contemplating the possibility of running. But last week, a new potential candidate stepped up to the stage, if not for this race, possibly for a future one. Dwayne Johnson, the actor formerly known by his professional wrestling moniker The Rock, told British GQ that he s considered a different kind of career. I ll be honest, I haven t ruled politics out. I m not being coy when I say that, but at the moment I am not sure, Johnson said. I can t deny that the thought of being governor, the thought of being president, is alluring. And beyond that, it would be an opportunity to make a real impact on people s lives on a global scale. But there are a lot of other things I want to do first. The prospect of yet another former reality television star running for higher office may feel improbable at best and horrifying at worst, given Trump s performance in the campaign thus far. And I can t vouch for Johnson s position on the issues though he s registered as a Republican and has appeared at the Republican convention to boost voter registration, he s generally talked less about actual policy and spent more time flashing his famously winning smile But just as I was an early champion of Johnson s acting abilities he s fascinating as a gay, closeted driver in Be Cool, mesmerizing as a an amnesiac who is not doing well in the post apocalypse in Southland Tales and one of the funniest parts of Michael Bay s wildly underrated Pain Gain I ve long thought that Johnson had a weirdly plausible path to a political career. He grew up all around the country because of his father s job but makes his home in Florida, an important state in presidential election years and the place where he played football for the University of Miami. The locker room was named for him after he made a major donation . Since his pivot to movie stardom, Johnson has become one of the most consistently likable celebrities in America, as measured by the Q Scores Company he d begin any race not just with high name recognition, but also with high favorable ratings. Johnson is even descended from James Bowles, a free black man who fought with the British during the Revolutionary War when the kingdom offered land and freedom to black Americans who joined their side. His mother s side of the family is Samoan. For a Republican Party that was desperate to woo nonwhite voters before Donald Trump tossed his toupee in the ring, and will be even harder pressed to woo them once our present mess is over, Johnson could be the sort of person the GOP tries to renovate into a viable candidate. If he doesn t have policy or issue bona fides, Johnson s relative silence on substance also means he doesn t have a record that can be used to tar him as some sort of flip flopper. And he could also make a series of carefully selected charitable and political donations designed to start building a record of positions. It s easier to teach talking points than charisma, as Sen. Ted Cruz R Tex. experienced earlier this year. Of course, if he really was going to try to follow Ronald Reagan s path to the presidency, Johnson would certainly have to run for something else first. And he could do it as early as this year Johnson has until June to get on the primary ballot in Florida and join the candidates who are competing for the Senate seat Marco Rubio decided to vacate when he ran for president. The prospect of The Rock sitting through committee hearings might be vaguely ridiculous, and a governorship would probably require him to take fewer potentially damaging votes. But the lesson of this year in American politics is that stranger things can always happen. And Trump is proof that if our politics are turning into reality television competitions, the results could always be worse.",

Related Fact Checking Everything Trump and Clinton Said About the FBI s Email Review A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on Weiner s laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton s server. Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information, the review didn t change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server. There were unseen emails, the official said, but they were unrelated to government business. The new letter indicates that the FBI s review is completed. Neither Comey nor the FBI are expected to release any other statements. Democrats and Republicans had starkly different reactions, although both sides indicated that, beyond Clinton s vindication, the FBI still had much to resolve. In the days that come, we will have many questions about the FBI s handling of this investigation, said John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. In the meantime, however, I welcome this news confirming again that no charges are warranted in this matter. Republicans quickly countered. Secretary Clinton s use of a private email server including to transmit classified information was extremely careless and a dereliction of duty, said Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. There are also several open questions about the FBI s examination of these facts. ",

        "text": "Former President Bill Clinton was a much more frequent flyer on a registered sex offender s infamous jet than previously reported, with flight logs showing the former president taking at least trips aboard the Lolita Express even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com. Clinton s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein s Boeing on occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between and included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including Tatiana. The tricked out jet earned its Nabakov inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls. Bill Clinton associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile, said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called TrafficKing. Why would a former president associate with a man like that? Virginia Roberts, , who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age , has previously claimed she saw Clinton at Epstein s getaway in , but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St. Thomas, the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epstein s plane. They do show Clinton flying aboard Epstein s plane to such destinations as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, the Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa. Among those regularly traveling with Clinton were Epstein s associates, New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein s assistant, Sarah Kellen, both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friends. In response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNews.com, the U.S. Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with Clinton. A Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former president s relationship and travels with Epstein. The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of Clinton s travel records. Martin Weinberg, Epstein s current attorney, did not respond to multiple inquiries. Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates have been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions. Police in Palm Beach, Fla., launched a year long investigation in into Epstein after parents of a year old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him. Police interviewed dozens of witnesses, confiscated his trash, performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion, ultimately identifying girls between the ages of and who they said were sexually abused by Epstein. In , at the request of Palm Beach Police, the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of and to engage in illegal sexual activities. According to court documents, police investigators found a clear indication that Epstein s staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of and years old literally every day, often two or three times per day. One victim, in sworn deposition testimony, said Epstein began sexually assaulting her when she was years old and molested her on more than occasions over the next three years. The girls testified they were lured to Epstein s home after being promised hundreds of dollars to be his model or masseuse, but when they arrived, he ordered them to take off their clothes and massage his naked body while he masturbated and used sex toys on them. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up. On Sept. , , in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a month sentence, including months of jail time and months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney s Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co conspirators. Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of Epstein s alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims to prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically connected billionaire and all of his co conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida did not respond to a request for comment about the deal. Other politicians, celebrities and businessmen, including presidential candidate Donald Trump, have been accused of fraternizing with Epstein. Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNews.com in a statement Trump and Epstein are not pals. There was no relationship between Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump, he said. They were not friends and they did not socialize together. ",

The automaker quickly shot down Donald Trump s latest hyperbolic claim, made on Fox News Thursday, that Ford plans to fire all its employees in the United States as part of a plan to build a plant in Mexico. Ford said there will be zero job losses in the U.S. as a result of the new plant in Mexico. The Wayne, Michigan, plant that now builds the Focus and C Max that will move to Mexico will instead start building other models probably the new Ford Bronco SUV and Ranger small pickup.

Trump has been using Ford for months as a prime example of what s wrong with U.S. trade policy, but Ford has been strongly rebutting the GOP nominee. The issue surfaced again on Wednesday when a Ford executive, speaking at a conference for investors, reiterated the company s plans to move its small car production to Mexico. Related President Trump would cost U.S. economy trillion During a Fox News interview, Trump vowed to impose a tax on cars built in Mexico if they re shipped back to the U.S. They think they re going to get away with this and they fire all their employees in the United States and...move to Mexico, said Trump.

One case came to light after relatives of a deceased man received a note congratulating him for registering, Rockingham County Commonwealth s Attorney Marsha Garst said Thursday. His family members were very distraught, said Garst, who confirmed the existence of the FBI and police investigation but said she could provide few details because the case is ongoing. All were initially registered as voters in the Shenandoah Valley city of Harrisonburg, although a clerk double checking the entries later raised questions about one. She recognized the name of Richard Allen Claybrook Sr., who died in at age , because his son is a well known local judge. She happened to recall that the judge s father had died. He was a retired Fairfax County elementary school principal and had fought in World War II, said his son, retired Harrisonburg General District Court Judge Richard Allen Claybrook Jr. So our family is very disgusted that they would pick his name, because he was such a law abiding citizen devoted to public service.

Oftentimes we hear our Democratic colleagues suggest that voter fraud doesn t exist in Virginia, or it s a myth, House Speaker William J. Howell R Stafford said. This is proof that voter fraud not only exists but is ongoing and is a threat to the integrity of our elections. House Minority Leader David J. Toscano D Charlottesville said the case was not proof of voter fraud because no one had actually managed to cast a vote in the names of the dead. First of all, there was no voter fraud they caught him, Toscano said. Nobody cast a vote. .?.?. There s still no evidence of that going on in the state.

        "text": "In any normal election year, we d compare the two presidential candidates side by side on the issues. But this is not a normal election year. A comparison like that would be an empty exercise in a race where one candidate our choice, Hillary Clinton has a record of service and a raft of pragmatic ideas, and the other, Donald Trump, discloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layaway. We will explain in a subsequent editorial why we believe Mr. Trump to be the worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American history. But this endorsement would also be an empty exercise if it merely affirmed the choice of Clinton supporters. We re aiming instead to persuade those of you who are hesitating to vote for Mrs. Clinton because you are reluctant to vote for a Democrat, or for another Clinton, or for a candidate who might appear, on the surface, not to offer change from an establishment that seems indifferent and a political system that seems broken. Running down the other guy won t suffice to make that argument. The best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isn t Donald Trump. The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs. Clinton s capacity to rise to them. Can Hillary Clinton Keep You Safe? SEPT. , The next president will take office with bigoted, tribalist movements and their leaders on the march. In the Middle East and across Asia, in Russia and Eastern Europe, even in Britain and the United States, war, terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values, fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charity. The campaign has brought to the surface the despair and rage of poor and middle class Americans who say their government has done little to ease the burdens that recession, technological change, foreign competition and war have heaped on their families. Over years in public life, Hillary Clinton has studied these forces and weighed responses to these problems. Our endorsement is rooted in respect for her intellect, experience, toughness and courage over a career of almost continuous public service, often as the first or only woman in the arena.",

        "text": "It seems we re entering another of those stupid seasons humans impose on themselves at fairly regular intervals. My background is archaeology, so also history and anthropology. It leads me to look at big historical patterns. My theory is that most peoples perspective of history is limited to the experience communicated by their parents and grandparents, so years. To go beyond that you have to read, study and learn to untangle the propaganda that is inevitable in all telling of history. In a nutshell, at university I would fail a paper if I didn t compare at least two, if not three opposing views on a topic. Taking one telling of events as gospel doesn t wash in the comparative analytical method of research that forms the core of British academia. I can t speak for other systems, but they re definitely not all alike in this way. So zooming out, we humans have a habit of going into phases of mass destruction, generally self imposed to some extent or another. This handy list shows all the wars over time. Wars are actually the norm for humans, but every now and then something big comes along. I am interested in the Black Death, which devastated Europe. The opening of Boccaccio s Decameron describes Florence in the grips of the Plague. It is as beyond imagination as the Somme, Hiroshima or the Holocaust. I mean, you quite literally can t put yourself there and imagine what it was like. For those in the midst of the Plague, it must have felt like the end of the world. Trump is a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself. But a defining feature of humans is their resilience. To us now, it seems obvious that we survived the Plague, but to people at the time it must have seemed incredible that their society continued afterwards. Indeed, many takes on the effects of the Black Death are that it had a positive impact in the long term. Well summed up here By targeting frail people of all ages, and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time, the Black Death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within Europe, ...In addition, the Black Death significantly changed the social structure of some European regions. Tragic depopulation created the shortage of working people. This shortage caused wages to rise. Products prices fell too. Consequently, standards of living increased. For instance, people started to consume more food of higher quality. But for the people living through it, as with the World Wars, Soviet Famines, Holocaust, it must have felt inconceivable that humans could rise up from it. The collapse of the Roman Empire, Black Death, Spanish Inquisition, Thirty Years War, War of the Roses, English Civil War... it s a long list. Events of massive destruction from which humanity recovered and move on, often in better shape. At a local level in time, people think things are fine then things rapidly spiral out of control until they become unstoppable, and we wreak massive destruction on ourselves. For the people living in the midst of this, it is hard to see happening and hard to understand. To historians later, it all makes sense and we see clearly how one thing led to another. During the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme I was struck that it was a direct outcome of the assassination of an Austrian Arch Duke in Bosnia. I very much doubt anyone at the time thought the killing of a minor European royal would lead to the death of million people. My point is that this is a cycle. It happens again and again, but as most people only have a year historical perspective they don t see that it s happening again. As the events that led to the First World War unfolded, there were a few brilliant minds who started to warn that something big was wrong, that the web of treaties across Europe could lead to a war, but they were dismissed as hysterical, mad, or fools, as is always the way, and as people who worry about Putin, Brexit and Trump are dismissed now. A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if you d listened and thought a bit. Then after the War to end all Wars, we went and had another one. Again, for a historian it was quite predictable. Lead people to feel they have lost control of their country and destiny, people look for scapegoats, a charismatic leader captures the popular mood, and singles out that scapegoat. He talks in rhetoric that has no detail, and drums up anger and hatred. Soon the masses start to move as one, without any logic driving their actions, and the whole becomes unstoppable. That was Hitler, but it was also Mussolini, Stalin, Putin, Mugabe and so many more. Mugabe is a very good case in point. He whipped up national anger and hatred towards the land owning white minority who happened to know how to run farms , and seized their land to redistribute to the people, in a great populist move which in the end unravelled the economy and farming industry and left the people in possession of land, but starving. See also the famines created by the Soviet Union, and the one caused by the Chinese Communists last century in which million people died. It seems inconceivable that people could create a situation in which tens of millions of people die without reason, but we do it again and again. But at the time people don t realize they re embarking on a route that will lead to a destruction period. They think they re right, they re cheered on by jeering angry mobs, their critics are mocked. This cycle, the one we saw for example from the Treaty of Versaille, to the rise of Hitler, to the Second World War, appears to be happening again. But as with before, most people cannot see it because . They are only looking at the present, not the past or future . They are only looking immediately around them, not at how events connect globally . Most people don t read, think, challenge or hear opposing views Trump is doing this in America. Those of us with some oversight from history can see it happening. Read this brilliant, long essay in the New York magazine to understand how Plato described all this, and it is happening just as he predicted. Trump says he will Make America Great Again, when in fact America is currently great, according to pretty well any statistics. He is using passion, anger and rhetoric in the same way all his predecessors did a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger, creating a cult around himself. You can blame society, politicians, the media, for America getting to the point that it s ready for Trump, but the bigger historical picture is that history generally plays out the same way each time someone like him becomes the boss. On a wider stage, zoom out some more, Russia is a dictatorship with a charismatic leader using fear and passion to establish a cult around himself. Turkey is now there too. Hungary, Poland, Slovakia are heading that way, and across Europe more Trumps and Putins are waiting in the wings, in fact funded by Putin, waiting for the popular tide to turn their way. We should be asking ourselves what our Archduke Ferdinand moment will be. How will an apparently small event trigger another period of massive destruction. We see Brexit, Trump, Putin in isolation. The world does not work that way? ? all things are connected and affecting each other. I have pro Brexit friends who say, Oh, you re going to blame that on Brexit too?? But they don t realize that actually, yes, historians will trace neat lines from apparently unrelated events back to major political and social shifts like Brexit. We are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination. Brexit a group of angry people winning a fight easily inspires other groups of angry people to start a similar fight, empowered with the idea that they may win. That alone can trigger chain reactions. A nuclear explosion is not caused by one atom splitting, but by the impact of the first atom that splits causing multiple other atoms near it to split, and they in turn causing multiple atoms to split. The exponential increase in atoms splitting, and their combined energy is the bomb. That is how World War One started and, ironically how World War Two ended. An example of how Brexit could lead to a nuclear war could be this Brexit in the UK causes Italy or France to have a similar referendum. Le Pen wins an election in France. Europe now has a fractured EU. The EU, for all its many awful faults, has prevented a war in Europe for longer than ever before. The EU is also a major force in suppressing Putin s military ambitions. European sanctions on Russia really hit the economy, and helped temper Russia s attacks on Ukraine there is a reason bad guys always want a weaker European Union . Trump wins in the US. Trump becomes isolationist, which weakens NATO. He has already said he would not automatically honor NATO commitments in the face of a Russian attack on the Baltics. With a fractured EU, and weakened NATO, Putin, facing an ongoing economic and social crisis in Russia, needs another foreign distraction around which to rally his people. He funds far right anti EU activists in Latvia, who then create a reason for an uprising of the Russian Latvians in the East of the country the EU border with Russia . Russia sends peace keeping forces and aid lorries into Latvia, as it did in Georgia, and in Ukraine. He cedes Eastern Latvia as he did Eastern Ukraine Crimea has the same population as Latvia, by the way . A divided Europe, with the leaders of France, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and others now pro Russia, anti EU, and funded by Putin, overrule calls for sanctions or a military response. NATO is slow to respond Trump does not want America to be involved, and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action. Russia, seeing no real resistance to their actions, move further into Latvia, and then into Eastern Estonia and Lithuania. The Baltic States declare war on Russia and start to retaliate, as they have now been invaded so have no choice. Half of Europe sides with them, a few countries remain neutral, and a few side with Russia. Where does Turkey stand on this? How does ISIS respond to a new war in Europe? Who uses a nuclear weapon first? This is just one Arch Duke Ferdinand scenario. The number of possible scenarios are infinite due to the massive complexity of the many moving parts. And of course many of them lead to nothing happening. But based on history we are due another period of destruction, and based on history all the indicators are that we are entering one. It will come in ways we can t see coming, and will spin out of control so fast people won t be able to stop it. Historians will look back and make sense of it all and wonder how we could all have been so na ve. How could I sit in a nice caf in London, writing this, without wanting to run away. How could people read it and make sarcastic and dismissive comments about how pro Remain people should stop whining, and how we shouldn t blame everything on Brexit. Others will read this and sneer at me for saying America is in great shape, that Trump is a possible future Hitler and yes, Godwin s Law. But my comparison is to another narcissistic, charismatic leader fanning flames of hatred until things spiral out of control . It s easy to jump to conclusions that oppose pessimistic predictions based on the weight of history and learning. Trump won against the other Republicans in debates by countering their claims by calling them names and dismissing them. It s an easy route but the wrong one. Ignoring and mocking the experts, as people are doing around Brexit and Trump s campaign, is no different to ignoring a doctor who tells you to stop smoking, and then finding later you ve developed incurable cancer. A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if you d listened and thought a bit. But people smoke, and people die from it. That is the way of the human. We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides. So I feel it s all inevitable. I don t know what it will be, but we are entering a bad phase. It will be unpleasant for those living through it, maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination. Humans will come out the other side, recover and move on. The human race will be fine, changed, maybe better. But for those at the sharp end for the thousands of Turkish teachers who just got fired, for the Turkish journalists and lawyers in prison, for the Russian dissidents in gulags, for people lying wounded in French hospitals after terrorist attacks, for those yet to fall, this will be their Somme. What can we do? Well, again, looking back, probably not much. The liberal intellectuals are always in the minority. See Clay Shirky s Twitter Storm on this point. The people who see that open societies, being nice to other people, not being racist, not fighting wars, is a better way to live, they generally end up losing these fights. They don t fight dirty. They are terrible at appealing to the populace. They are less violent, so end up in prisons, camps, and graves. We need to beware not to become divided see Labour party , we need to avoid getting lost in arguing through facts and logic, and counter the populist messages of passion and anger with our own similar messages. We need to understand and use social media. We need to harness a different fear. Fear of another World War nearly stopped World War , but didn t. We need to avoid our own echo chambers. Trump and Putin supporters don t read the Guardian, so writing there is just reassuring our friends. We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups, try to cross the ever widening social divides. Perhaps I m just writing this so I can be remembered by history as one of the people who saw it coming. ",

        "text": "During a year career at the Central Intelligence Agency, I served presidents of both parties three Republicans and three Democrats. I was at President George W. Bush s side when we were attacked on Sept. as deputy director of the agency, I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in . I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. In my years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president. No longer. On Nov. , I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our th president. Two strongly held beliefs have brought me to this decision. First, Mrs. Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J. Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security. I spent four years working with Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, most often in the White House Situation Room. In these critically important meetings, I found her to be prepared, detail oriented, thoughtful, inquisitive and willing to change her mind if presented with a compelling argument. I also saw the secretary s commitment to our nation s security her belief that America is an exceptional nation that must lead in the world for the country to remain secure and prosperous her understanding that diplomacy can be effective only if the country is perceived as willing and able to use force if necessary and, most important, her capacity to make the most difficult decision of all whether to put young American women and men in harm s way. Mrs. Clinton was an early advocate of the raid that brought Bin Laden to justice, in opposition to some of her most important colleagues on the National Security Council. During the early debates about how we should respond to the Syrian civil war, she was a strong proponent of a more aggressive approach, one that might have prevented the Islamic State from gaining a foothold in Syria. I never saw her bring politics into the Situation Room. In fact, I saw the opposite. When some wanted to delay the Bin Laden raid by one day because the White House Correspondents Dinner might be disrupted, she said, Screw the White House Correspondents Dinner. In sharp contrast to Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump has no experience on national security. Even more important, the character traits he has exhibited during the primary season suggest he would be a poor, even dangerous, commander in chief. These traits include his obvious need for self aggrandizement, his overreaction to perceived slights, his tendency to make decisions based on intuition, his refusal to change his views based on new information, his routine carelessness with the facts, his unwillingness to listen to others and his lack of respect for the rule of law. The dangers that flow from Mr. Trump s character are not just risks that would emerge if he became president. It is already damaging our national security. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a career intelligence officer, trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them. That is exactly what he did early in the primaries. Mr. Putin played upon Mr. Trump s vulnerabilities by complimenting him. He responded just as Mr. Putin had calculated. Mr. Putin is a great leader, Mr. Trump says, ignoring that he has killed and jailed journalists and political opponents, has invaded two of his neighbors and is driving his economy to ruin. Mr. Trump has also taken policy positions consistent with Russian, not American, interests endorsing Russian espionage against the United States, supporting Russia s annexation of Crimea and giving a green light to a possible Russian invasion of the Baltic States. In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation. Mr. Trump has also undermined security with his call for barring Muslims from entering the country. This position, which so clearly contradicts the foundational values of our nation, plays into the hands of the jihadist narrative that our fight against terrorism is a war between religions. In fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the C.I.A. s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the Sept. attacks. My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the C.I.A. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president.",

POLITICO confirmed the other day that Clinton s email investigation is a criminal investigation, as stated by Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan Judge links Clinton aide s immunity to criminal investigation A former information technology aide to Hillary Clinton received immunity from the Justice Department in connection with a criminal investigation, a federal judge confirmed Tuesday. Bryan Pagliano, a computer expert who worked at the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state and was also paid privately by her, was previously reported to have received immunity in connection with statements he gave to the FBI about Clinton s private server set up. However, there had been no explicit confirmation that the investigation which Clinton has repeatedly referred to as a security review is actually a criminal probe. The privacy interests at stake are high because the government s criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in an order issued Tuesday. When a U.S. District Court Judge confirms your opponent faces a criminal investigation, there s no reason to concede or leave a race for the presidency. Furthermore, Judge Sullivan clearly stated The privacy interests at stake are high because the government s criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential. Clinton s security review days are over, especially since the White House also confirmed the criminal investigation. But there s no chance of Clinton facing legal consequences, right? If you know the answer to this question, then tell the world next year s winner of the Super Bowl. Also, explain how Clinton circumvents repercussions from the following NBC article titled Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top Secret Emails from Hillary Clinton s home server contained information classified at levels higher than previously known, including a level meant to protect some of the most sensitive U.S. intelligence, according to a document obtained by NBC News. In a letter to lawmakers, the intelligence community s internal watchdog says some of Clinton s emails contained information classified Top Secret Special Access Program, a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held U.S. intelligence matters. Two American intelligence officials tell NBC News these are not the same two emails from Clinton s server that have long been reported as containing information deemed Top Secret While she was secretary of state from to , Clinton conducted government business over private email. The arrangement was particularly unusual because the email system relied not on Yahoo or Google but her own server, which she kept in her home in Westchester County, N.Y. The act of transferring Special Access Program intelligence from secure government networks onto an unsecure private server correlates directly to the Espionage Act. I explain why Clinton s Special Access Program intelligence will lead to a Bernie Sanders presidency in the following YouTube segment. Finally, nothing proves both election fraud and a Bernie Sanders presidency better than Clinton s treatment of donors. As stated by CNN last week, Secretary of State Clinton put a Chicago commodities trader on an advisory board regarding nuclear strategy Washington CNN A major political donor to the Clintons and other top Democrats was selected by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to serve on a key State Department intelligence board in , despite having no clear background in the area, according to emails released this week In July , Fernando was appointed to a seat on the International Security Advisory Board ISAB , a panel filled with top level foreign policy advisers and security experts. Former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart chairs the current panel, which includes retired generals, the former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other high ranking national security experts As a member of the top level group, Fernando was granted a Top Secret security clearance and given access to highly sensitive information. Fernando, professional State Department staff noted, seemed an awkward selection for the group and spurred concern when an ABC News reporter inquired about him in An aide, Wade Boese, replied that night that Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills had added Fernando s name to the list of appointees approved by Clinton. The true answer is that S staff Cheryl Mills added him. The board s membership preceded me. Raj was not on the list sent to S he was added at their insistence, Boese wrote. S refers to Clinton, ABC News reported. Not only did this commodities trader have no background in nuclear strategy, but he s also a Democratic super delegate. Still believe the system didn t favor Clinton? From private servers to advisory boards with donors and super delegates, Clinton s candidacy is unique in American history. I recently challenged Nate Cohn and Harry Enten polling experts who failed to predict the rise of Bernie or Trump on the data pertaining to presidential candidates and FBI criminal investigations. I asked if they could crunch the numbers, and come up with some kind of analysis on whether or not Clinton will become president, based on prior candidates facing FBI criminal probes. Something tells me that most observers have conveniently ignored the fact Bernie s challenger risks serious legal consequences. One can only imagine what pundits would say about Bernie Sanders if he were in Clinton s position. Therefore, Bernie has every reason to stay in the race, especially since nobody has ever become nominee alongside an FBI criminal probe. With Bernie Sanders, there s no risk of scandal or FBI investigations. The talk of Bernie leaving the race must stop, especially since Clinton s emails will dominate the media very soon. Bernie Sanders just made it official, and after the FBI discloses its findings, expect Bernie Sanders to become Democratic Nominee. The data driven analysis on candidates with ongoing FBI criminal investigations says Bernie Sanders is still the front runner in .",

        "text": "On Sunday s Last Week Tonight, John Oliver finally took on billionaire Donald Trump. I get that the character of Donald Trump is entertaining, and that he says things that people want to hear, Oliver said. And I know that his very name is powerful. But Oliver argued that Trump isn t what he seems. Here are some of the qualities many supporters have listed about Trump and Oliver s counterpoints He tells it like it is Does he? Because the website PolitiFact checked of his statements, and rated percent of them as varying degrees of false. He is truly independent and not beholden to anyone While it is true that he hasn t taken corporate money, the implication that he has personally spent to million is a bit of a stretch, because what he s actually done is loaned his own campaign . million and has just personally given just , . And that s important, because up until the convention he can pay himself back for the loan with campaign funds. He s tough For a tough guy, he has incredibly thin skin. Back in , Spy magazine called him a short fingered vulgarian. And ever since, the editor Graydon Carter says he receives envelopes from Trump, always with a photo on which he circled his hand to highlight the length of his fingers, usually with a note reading, See, not so short! His success While yes, he has made more money than most of us will make in a lifetime, not only did he get a multimillion dollar inheritance from his father, but he s also lost a huge amount. Oliver then played a clip of Trump s daughter saying, I remember once my father and I were walking down Fifth Avenue and there was a homeless person sitting right outside of Trump Tower. And I remember my father pointing to him and saying, You know, that guy has billion more than me. Because he was in such extreme debt at that point. Oliver also noted one other issue with Trump He s wildly inconsistent. He s been pro choice and pro life, for and against assault weapon bans, in favor of both bringing in Syrian refugees and deporting them out of the country. Or take Trump s inconsistent statements on former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke s endorsement of Trump. To CNN, Trump said, I don t know anything about David Duke. Okay? I don t know anything about what you re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. Oliver was not having it, pointing to Trump s past remarks to journalists Really? That s your best answer there? Because you definitely know who he is partly because you called him a bigot and a racist in the past. Oliver concluded that the best way to take down Trump is to uncouple him from his brand his name. And it turns out that the Trump family s name was once Drumpf. Oliver explained how this could work If you are thinking of voting for Donald Trump, the charismatic guy promising to make America great again, stop and take a moment to imagine how you would feel if you just met a guy named Donald Drumpf, a litigious serial liar with a string of broken business ventures and the support of a former Klan leader who he can t decide whether or not to condemn. Would you think he would make a good president, or is the spell now somewhat broken? That is why tonight I am asking America to make Donald Drumpf again, Oliver added. Oliver then announced the launch of the MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain and the website DonaldJDrumpf.com, where anyone can download a browser extension that replaces Trump s name with Drumpf. We cannot keep getting blinded by the magic of his name, Oliver said. So please, don t think of him as Donald Trump. Think of him as something else. ",

        "text": "As a retired military officer, I watched last night s Republican debate from Detroit transcript here with a special focus on which candidate is qualified to lead the military as commander in chief. I knew, of course, that Donald Trump had promised in the past to use torture against America s enemies last night, he called them animals , that he would pursue and kill not only terrorists but their families apparently because the families always know, according to Trump, what their father brother sister is up to, as if there are no secrets in families . Trump, in short, is an Old Testament eye for an eye man if they behead us, we ll torture and kill them, end of story. But Trump was put on the spot when he was asked what he would do if the U.S. military failed to carry out his unlawful orders. Instead of saying he wouldn t issue unlawful orders, that he would support and defend the U.S. Constitution, which as president would be his sworn duty to uphold, Trump boasted that the military would follow his orders no matter what. America those are the words of a dictator. Here s what was said BAIER Mr. Trump, just yesterday, almost foreign policy experts signed on to an open letter refusing to support you, saying your embracing expansive use of torture is inexcusable. General Michael Hayden, former CIA director, NSA director, and other experts have said that when you asked the U.S. military to carry out some of your campaign promises, specifically targeting terrorists families, and also the use of interrogation methods more extreme than waterboarding, the military will refuse because they ve been trained to turn down and refuse illegal orders. So what would you do, as commander in chief, if the U.S. military refused to carry out those orders? TRUMP They won t refuse. They re not going to refuse me. Believe me. BAIER But they re illegal. TRUMP Let me just tell you, you look at the Middle East. They re chopping off heads. They re chopping off the heads of Christians and anybody else that happens to be in the way. They re drowning people in steel cages. And he now we re talking about waterboarding. This really started with Ted, a question was asked of Ted last two debates ago about waterboarding. And Ted was, you know, having a hard time with that question, to be totally honest with you. They then came to me, what do you think of waterboarding? I said it s fine. And if we want to go stronger, I d go stronger, too, because, frankly... APPLAUSE ... that s the way I feel. Can you imagine can you imagine these people, these animals over in the Middle East, that chop off heads, sitting around talking and seeing that we re having a hard problem with waterboarding? We should go for waterboarding and we should go tougher than waterboarding. That s my opinion. BAIER But targeting terrorists families? APPLAUSE TRUMP And and and I m a leader. I m a leader. I ve always been a leader. I ve never had any problem leading people. If I say do it, they re going to do it. That s what leadership is all about. Our military does not follow blindly orders issued by The Leader. Our military swears an oath to the Constitution. We swear to uphold the law of the land. We don t swear allegiance to a single man or woman as president. Trump s performance last night reminded me of Richard Nixon s infamous answer to David Frost about Watergate When the president does it, that means it s not illegal. No, no, a thousand times no. The president has to obey the law of the land, just as everyone else has to. No person is above the law, an American ideal that Trump seems neither to understand nor to embrace. And that disqualifies him to be president and commander in chief.",

        "text": "We are really ready for this presidential election to be over. We re ready for an end to the rancor and tackiness. Voters on both sides feel frustrated, even embarrassed by it all. There is a visceral fear, an angst about the result. What if so and so wins? When we wake up to November , post election, when the confetti is swept away and the election is finally over, what will we see? I have a prediction. I know exactly what November will bring. Another day of God s perfect sovereignty. He will still be in charge. His throne will still be occupied. He will still manage the affairs of the world. Never before has His providence depended on a king, president, or ruler. And it won t on November , . The LORD can control a king s mind as he controls a river he can direct it as he pleases Proverbs NCV . On one occasion the Lord turned the heart of the King of Assyria so that he aided them in the construction of the Temple. On another occasion, he stirred the heart of Cyrus to release the Jews to return to Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar was considered to be the mightiest king of his generation. But God humbled and put him in detention for seven years. The kingdom is the Lord s, and He rules over the nations Psalms . Understanding God s sovereignty over the nations opens the door to peace. When we realize that God influences the hearts of all rulers, we can then choose to pray for them rather than fret about them. Rather than wring our hands we bend our knees, we select prayer over despair. Jeremiah did this. He was the prophet to Israel during one of her darkest periods of rebellion. He was called the weeping prophet because he was one. He wept at the condition of the people and the depravity of their faith. He was so distraught that one of his books was entitled Lamentations. But then he considered the work of God. Note the intentionality of his words This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. The LORD s lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail. They are new every morning Great is Your faithfulness. Lam. Imitate Jeremiah. Lift up your eyes. Dare to believe that good things will happen. Dare to believe that God was speaking to us when he said In everything God works for the good of those who love him Romans . Many years ago, I spent a week visiting the interior of Brazil with a long time missionary pilot. He flew a circuit of remote towns in a small plane that threatened to come undone at the slightest gust of wind. Wilbur and Orville had a sturdier aircraft. I could not get comfortable. I kept thinking that the plane was going to crash in some Brazilian jungle and I d be gobbled up by piranhas or swallowed by an anaconda. I kept shifting around, looking down, and gripping my seat. As if that would help. Finally, the pilot had had enough of my squirming. He looked at me and shouted over the airplane noise. We won t face anything I can t handle. You might as well trust me to fly the plane. Is God saying the same to you? If so, make this your prayer Dear Lord, You are perfect. You could not be better than you are. You are self created. You exist because you choose to exist. You are self sustaining. No one helps you. No one gives you strength. You are self governing. Who can question your deeds? Who dares advise you? You are correct. In every way. In every choice. You regret no decision. You have never failed. Never! You cannot fail! You are God! You will accomplish your plan. You are happy. Eternally joyful. Endlessly content. You are the king, supreme ruler, absolute monarch, overlord, and rajah of all history. An arch of your eyebrow and a million angels will pivot and salute. Every throne is a footstool to yours. Every crown is papier m ch to yours. No limitations, hesitations, questions, second thoughts, or backward glances. You consult no clock. You keep no calendar. You report to no one. You are in charge. And I trust you. Circle November on your calendar and write upon it the words Our good God rules the world.",

        "text": "As the father of three daughters, I reserved the right to interview their dates. Seemed only fair to me. After all, my wife and I d spent or years feeding them, dressing them, funding braces and driving them to volleyball tournaments and piano recitals. A five minute face to face with the guy was a fair expectation. For the next few hours, she would be affected by his ability to drive a car, avoid the bad crowds and stay sober. I wanted to know if he could do it. I wanted to know if he was decent. This was my word decent. Would he treat my daughter with kindness and respect? Could he be trusted to bring her home on time? In his language, actions and decisions, would he be a decent guy? Decency mattered to me as a dad, and decency matters to Americans. We take note of the person who pays their debts. We appreciate the physician who takes time to listen. When the husband honors his wedding vows, when the teacher makes time for the struggling student, when the employee refuses to gossip about her co worker, when the losing team congratulates the winning team, we can characterize their behavior as decent. We appreciate decency. We applaud decency. We teach decency. We seek to develop decency. So why isn t decency doing better in the presidential race? The leading Republican candidate to be the next leader of the free world would not pass my decency interview. I d send him away. I d tell my daughter to stay home. I don t know Mr. Trump. But I ve been chagrined at his antics. He ridiculed a war hero. He made a mockery of a reporter s menstrual cycle. He made fun of a disabled reporter. He referred to a former first lady, Barbara Bush, as mommy and belittled Jeb Bush for bringing her on the campaign trail. He routinely calls people stupid and dummy. One writer catalogued occasions that he called someone loser. These were not off line, backstage, overheard, not to be repeated comments. They were publicly and intentionally tweeted, recorded and presented. Such insensitivities wouldn t be acceptable even for a middle school student body election. But for the Oval Office? And to do so while brandishing a Bible and boasting of his Christian faith? I have no inside track on the intricacies of a presidential campaign. I m a pastor. I don t endorse candidates or place bumper stickers on my car. But I am protective of the Christian faith. If a public personality calls on Christ one day and calls someone a bimbo the next, is something not awry? And to do so, not once, but repeatedly, unrepentantly and unapologetically? We stand against bullying in schools. Shouldn t we do the same in presidential politics? Could concerns be raised about other Christian candidates? Absolutely. But the concern of this article is not policy but tone and decorum. Prior presidents have exercised a restraint of the tongue. It s hard to imagine George H.W. Bush using locker room language to demean an opponent on a debate stage. I didn t vote for President Obama, but I appreciate the manner in which he has maintained the comportment of the office. At least we don t wince when he stands to speak. When it comes to language, Mr. Trump inhabits a league of his own. Some of my friends tell me that his language is a virtue. But I respectfully part company with my Christian colleagues who chalk up his abrasive nature to candor. For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks, Jesus said. Words are a heart monitor. Christians would do well to summon any Christian leader to a higher heart standard. This includes pastors especially this one , teachers, coaches and, by all means, presidential candidates. All of them. The stock explanation for Mr. Trump s success is this He has tapped into the anger of the American people. As one man said, We are voting with our middle finger. Sounds more like a comment for a gang fight than a presidential election. Anger fueled reactions have caused trouble ever since Cain was angry at Abel. We can only hope, and pray, for a return to verbal decency. Perhaps Mr. Trump will better manage his comments. Worthy of a prayer, for sure. Or, perhaps the American public will remember the key role of the president to be the face of America. When he or she speaks, he or she speaks for us. Whether we agree or disagree with the policies of the president, do we not hope that they speak in a way that is consistent with the status of the office? As far as I remember, I never turned away one of my daughter s dates. They weren t perfect, but they were decent fellows. That was all I could ask. It seems that we should ask the same of these candidates.",

Three years before she met husband Donald Trump, Melania Trump was snapped in a nude frolic with another female model, bombshell photos obtained exclusively by The Post show. Modal Trigger The lesbian themed pics are from a two day photo shoot in Manhattan in , when Melania Knauss, as she was called, was years old and modeling under the name Melania K. Photographer Al de Basse ville later told The Post that he misspoke, and the photo session actually took place in in Manhattan, and appeared in a issue of the magazine. Several were featured in Max Magazine, a now defunct French men s monthly, more than years ago. Others have never been in print until now. The raciest of the photos shows Melania lying nude in a bed as Scandinavian model Emma Eriksson, also naked, embraces her from behind, just below her breasts, which are fully exposed. In another photo, Eriksson wears sheer stockings, a low cut bustier, high heels and a long robe all designed by John Galliano and raises a whip as if preparing to spank Melania, who pretends to recoil. Melania is more conservatively dressed in a skin tight gown and high heels. I always loved women together, because I have been with a lot of women who desired the m nage trois, said Jarl Ale de Basseville, the French fashion photographer who snapped the pictures. Melania Trump right poses for the January issue of Max Magazine.Photo Jarl Ale de Basseville This is beauty and not porn. I am always shocked by the porn industry because they are destroying the emotion and the essence of purity and simplicity. Part of the shoot, which de Basseville said was inspired by Renaissance art, took place on the building s rooftop, said a fashion industry insider who was present at one of the photo sessions. Melania behaved like a true professional during one of the nighttime shoots with Eriksson, the source said. She was charming throughout, said the source, adding that the pics lesbian theme didn t faze her. She was always smiling, with a very pleasant personality and was polite and very well educated. Al de Basse villePhoto Al de Basse ville Melania had recently arrived in the city from modeling stints in Paris and Milan at the time.

Her sexy photo spread appeared in the January issue of Max Magazine, whose cover featured a photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford. In addition to the lesbian themed shots, de Basseville took several nude pictures of Melania from different angles. In one of them, Melania pouts at the camera while clad only in stilettos. In another, her back is to the camera, and her arms are raised as if up against a wall. I think it is important to show the beauty and freedom of the woman, and I am very proud of these pictures because they celebrate Melania s beauty, de Basseville said. Asked about the photos, Donald Trump said Melania was one of the most successful models, and she did many photo shoots, including for covers and major magazines. This was a picture taken for a European magazine prior to my knowing Melania. In Europe, pictures like this are very fashionable and common.

        "text": "Let us now address the greatest American mystery at the moment what motivates the supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump? I call it a mystery because the working class white people who make up the bulk of Trump s fan base show up in amazing numbers for the candidate, filling stadiums and airport hangars, but their views, by and large, do not appear in our prestige newspapers. On their opinion pages, these publications take care to represent demographic categories of nearly every kind, but blue collar is one they persistently overlook. The views of working class people are so foreign to that universe that when New York Times columnist Nick Kristof wanted to engage a Trump supporter last week, he made one up, along with this imaginary person s responses to his questions. When members of the professional class wish to understand the working class Other, they traditionally consult experts on the subject. And when these authorities are asked to explain the Trump movement, they always seem to zero in on one main accusation bigotry. Only racism, they tell us, is capable of powering a movement like Trump s, which is blowing through the inherited structure of the Republican party like a tornado through a cluster of McMansions. Trump himself provides rather excellent evidence for this finding. The man is an insult clown who has systematically gone down the list of American ethnic groups and offended them each in turn. He wants to deport millions upon millions of undocumented immigrants. He wants to bar Muslims from visiting the United States. He admires various foreign strongmen and dictators, and has even retweeted a quote from Mussolini. This gold plated buffoon has in turn drawn the enthusiastic endorsement of leading racists from across the spectrum of intolerance, a gorgeous mosaic of haters, each of them quivering excitedly at the prospect of getting a real, honest to god bigot in the White House. All this stuff is so insane, so wildly outrageous, that the commentariat has deemed it to be the entirety of the Trump campaign. Trump appears to be a racist, so racism must be what motivates his armies of followers. And so, on Saturday, New York Times columnist Timothy Egan blamed none other than the people for Trump s racism Donald Trump s supporters know exactly what he stands for hatred of immigrants, racial superiority, a sneering disregard of the basic civility that binds a society. Stories marveling at the stupidity of Trump voters are published nearly every day. Articles that accuse Trump s followers of being bigots have appeared by the hundreds, if not the thousands. Conservatives have written them liberals have written them impartial professionals have written them. The headline of a recent Huffington Post column announced, bluntly, that Trump Won Super Tuesday Because America is Racist. A New York Times reporter proved that Trump s followers were bigots by coordinating a map of Trump support with a map of racist Google searches. Everyone knows it Trump s followers passions are nothing more than the ignorant blurtings of the white American id, driven to madness by the presence of a black man in the White House. The Trump movement is a one note phenomenon, a vast surge of race hate. Its partisans are not only incomprehensible, they are not really worth comprehending. Or so we re told. Last week, I decided to watch several hours of Trump speeches for myself. I saw the man ramble and boast and threaten and even seem to gloat when protesters were ejected from the arenas in which he spoke. I was disgusted by these things, as I have been disgusted by Trump for years. But I also noticed something surprising. In each of the speeches I watched, Trump spent a good part of his time talking about an entirely legitimate issue, one that could even be called leftwing. Yes, Donald Trump talked about trade. In fact, to judge by how much time he spent talking about it, trade may be his single biggest concern not white supremacy. Not even his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, the issue that first won him political fame. He did it again during the debate on March asked about his political excommunication by Mitt Romney, he chose to pivot and talk about trade. It seems to obsess him the destructive free trade deals our leaders have made, the many companies that have moved their production facilities to other lands, the phone calls he will make to those companies CEOs in order to threaten them with steep tariffs unless they move back to the US. Trump embellished this vision with another favorite leftwing idea under his leadership, the government would start competitive bidding in the drug industry . We don t competitively bid! he marveled another true fact, a legendary boondoggle brought to you by the George W Bush administration. Trump extended the critique to the military industrial complex, describing how the government is forced to buy lousy but expensive airplanes thanks to the power of industry lobbyists. Thus did he hint at his curious selling proposition because he is personally so wealthy, a fact about which he loves to boast, Trump himself is unaffected by business lobbyists and donations. And because he is free from the corrupting power of modern campaign finance, famous deal maker Trump can make deals on our behalf that are good instead of bad . The chance that he will actually do so, of course, is small. He appears to be a hypocrite on this issue as well as so many other things. But at least Trump is saying this stuff. All this surprised me because, for all the articles about Trump I had read in recent months, I didn t recall trade coming up very often. Trump is supposed to be on a one note crusade for whiteness. Could it be that all this trade stuff is a key to understanding the Trump phenomenon? Trade is an issue that polarizes Americans by socio economic status. To the professional class, which encompasses the vast majority of our media figures, economists, Washington officials and Democratic powerbrokers, what they call free trade is something so obviously good and noble it doesn t require explanation or inquiry or even thought. Republican and Democratic leaders alike agree on this, and no amount of facts can move them from their Econ dream. To the remaining or of America, trade means something very different. There s a video going around on the internet these days that shows a room full of workers at a Carrier air conditioning plant in Indiana being told by an officer of the company that the factory is being moved to Monterrey, Mexico, and that they re all going to lose their jobs. As I watched it, I thought of all the arguments over trade that we ve had in this country since the early s, all the sweet words from our economists about the scientifically proven benevolence of free trade, all the ways in which our newspapers mock people who say that treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement allow companies to move jobs to Mexico. Well, here is a video of a company moving its jobs to Mexico, courtesy of Nafta. This is what it looks like. The Carrier executive talks in that familiar and highly professional HR language about the need to stay competitive and the extremely price sensitive marketplace . A worker shouts Fuck you! at the executive. The executive asks people to please be quiet so he can share his information . His information about all of them losing their jobs. Now, I have no special reason to doubt the suspicion that Donald Trump is a racist. Either he is one, or as the comedian John Oliver puts it he is pretending to be one, which amounts to the same thing. But there is another way to interpret the Trump phenomenon. A map of his support may coordinate with racist Google searches, but it coordinates even better with deindustrialization and despair, with the zones of economic misery that years of Washington s free market consensus have brought the rest of America. It is worth noting that Trump is making a point of assailing that Indiana air conditioning company from the video in his speeches. What this suggests is that he s telling a tale as much about economic outrage as it is tale of racism on the march. Many of Trump s followers are bigots, no doubt, but many more are probably excited by the prospect of a president who seems to mean it when he denounces our trade agreements and promises to bring the hammer down on the CEO that fired you and wrecked your town, unlike Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Here is the most salient supporting fact when people talk to white, working class Trump supporters, instead of simply imagining what they might say, they find that what most concerns these people is the economy and their place in it. I am referring to a study just published by Working America, a political action auxiliary of the AFL CIO, which interviewed some , white working class voters in the suburbs of Cleveland and Pittsburgh in December and January. Support for Donald Trump, the group found, ran strong among these people, even among self identified Democrats, but not because they are all pining for a racist in the White House. Their favorite aspect of Trump was his attitude , the blunt and forthright way he talks. As far as issues are concerned, immigration placed third among the matters such voters care about, far behind their number one concern good jobs the economy . People are much more frightened than they are bigoted, is how the findings were described to me by Karen Nussbaum, the executive director of Working America. The survey confirmed what we heard all the time people are fed up, people are hurting, they are very distressed about the fact that their kids don t have a future and that there still hasn t been a recovery from the recession, that every family still suffers from it in one way or another. Tom Lewandowski, the president of the Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council in Fort Wayne, puts it even more bluntly when I asked him about working class Trump fans. These people aren t racist, not any more than anybody else is, he says of Trump supporters he knows. When Trump talks about trade, we think about the Clinton administration, first with Nafta and then with Permanent Normal Trade Relations China, and here in Northeast Indiana, we hemorrhaged jobs. They look at that, and here s Trump talking about trade, in a ham handed way, but at least he s representing emotionally. We ve had all the political establishment standing behind every trade deal, and we endorsed some of these people, and then we ve had to fight them to get them to represent us. Now, let us stop and smell the perversity. Left parties the world over were founded to advance the fortunes of working people. But our left party in America one of our two monopoly parties chose long ago to turn its back on these people s concerns, making itself instead into the tribune of the enlightened professional class, a creative class that makes innovative things like derivative securities and smartphone apps. The working people that the party used to care about, Democrats figured, had nowhere else to go, in the famous Clinton era expression. The party just didn t need to listen to them any longer. What Lewandowski and Nussbaum are saying, then, should be obvious to anyone who s dipped a toe outside the prosperous enclaves on the two coasts. Ill considered trade deals and generous bank bailouts and guaranteed profits for insurance companies but no recovery for average people, ever these policies have taken their toll. As Trump says, we have rebuilt China and yet our country is falling apart. Our infrastructure is falling apart Our airports are, like, Third World. Trump s words articulate the populist backlash against liberalism that has been building slowly for decades and may very well occupy the White House itself, whereupon the entire world will be required to take seriously its demented ideas. Yet still we cannot bring ourselves to look the thing in the eyes. We cannot admit that we liberals bear some of the blame for its emergence, for the frustration of the working class millions, for their blighted cities and their downward spiraling lives. So much easier to scold them for their twisted racist souls, to close our eyes to the obvious reality of which Trumpism is just a crude and ugly expression that neoliberalism has well and truly failed. Thomas Frank is the author of Listen, Liberal or Whatever Happened to the Party of the People, published March by Metropolitan Books This article was amended on March to reflect the fact that Nafta stands for the North American Free Trade Agreement. An earlier version of this article referred to it as North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. ",

        "text": "Park City, Utah CNN Mitt Romney suggested Friday that Donald Trump s election could legitimize racism and misogyny, ushering in a change in the moral fabric of American society. The Republican nominee, who has openly opposed Trump s candidacy, went further than he has before in outlining to CNN s Wolf Blitzer how the country s character would suffer in a Trump White House. Trump s rhetoric has caused even some other Republicans to label him a racist, and Romney said he would not be able to paper over his incendiary remarks. I don t want to see trickle down racism, Romney said in an interview here in a suite overlooking the Wasatch Mountains, where he is hosting his yearly ideas conference. I don t want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following. Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle down racism, trickle down bigotry, trickle down misogyny, all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America. Romney retreat puts spotlight on Trump s fundraising problem in critical stretch Trump, speaking at a rally in Richmond, Virginia, Friday night, didn t address Romney s criticism directly but did say, I am the least racist person, the least racist person that you ve ever seen, a line he frequently says at campaign events. By Saturday morning, Trump was directly responding to Romney, tweeting, Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist but I am least racist person there is. Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog. Now he calls me racist but I am least racist person there is He then added, Don King, and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me, would not have done so if they thought I was a racist! He kept up his attacks while speaking at a campaign rally on Saturday in Tampa, Florida, telling the crowd, I don t think he knows what a misogynist is. Don t forget this guy let us down. He would later double down on the criticism at a campaign event in Pittsburgh. Romney considering Johnson Romney, who actively sought to recruit an independent, third party challenger to Trump, also conceded that a credible candidate will not emerge. But he did show a new openness to one non Trump candidate, libertarian Gary Johnson, whom he did not rule out voting for. Johnson s running mate is another former Massachusetts governor, Bill Weld, who once fundraised for Romney. If the ticket was flipped and Weld was the standard bearer, Romney said he would have no qualms about voting for the libertarian ticket this fall. Hillary Clinton huddles with top fundraisers If Bill Weld were at the top of the ticket, it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president, Romney said. So I ll get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he s someone who I could end up voting for. That s something which I ll evaluate over the coming weeks and months. Romney s comments on The Situation Room are some of the highest profile support bestowed upon the libertarian ticket, which is almost certain to be less funded compared to the GOP and Democratic lines. He did however express an uneasiness with Johnson, given his position on marijuana legalization. Marijuana makes people stupid, Romney quipped. Johnson said Saturday that others should join Romney in giving the Libertarian nominees a closer look. I think Mitt Romney hit it on the head. He said, Hey, I m going to check out Gary Johnson and see what he s got to say, he told CNN s Victor Blackwell on CNN Newsroom. I think that kind of scrutiny holds up under the light of day. The race, Obama s legacy, congressional gridlock get the most important political news delivered to your inbox. By subscribing, you agree to our privacy policy. Romney once again ruled out running himself, but he was also candid about independent efforts to recruit a challenger. Several sought after Republicans, including Ben Sasse and author David French, have taken passes. Orrin Hatch explains friendship with Muhammad Ali I think you re not going to find a credible candidate actually running as a third party contender, Romney said. The only way to win the White House, in my view, is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party, and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people I think the chance to express their own views about Mr. Trump or about Secretary Clinton. Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, appearing later on The Situation Room, dismissed Romney s criticism. This again is just sour grapes from the establishment who have had the power stripped out of theirs hands by a candidate that they do not like because he has managed to do something they have been unable to do for decades, Pierson said. And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted later Friday, Respect Mitt and differences but couldn t disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let s stop this and unify. Respect Mitt and differences but couldn t disagree more. SCOTUS too important to lose for generations. Let s stop this and unify. In Richmond, Trump alluded to his critics, though he didn t mention Romney by name. Clinton donor received top spot on State Department intel board These poor people going, Never Trump, never Trump they ve been doing it for months. They did it with Indiana, they did it with New York We re going to win New York and I won in a massive landslide. My choice is different Romney again speculated about what might be in Trump s tax returns, which he has repeatedly declined to release, claiming that he s under audit. Asked what might be in there, Romney referred to a months ago comment by Trump that he could not lose support even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City. He s calculated that he could get support even if he shot someone, but if he released his taxes, he d lose support, Romney said. So there s something in those taxes that s even worse than shooting someone on Fifth Avenue. Yet Romney declined to criticize other Republicans who have harbored similar feelings about Trump but endorsed him. Romney s mentee and vice presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, has uneasily backed Trump, but Romney declined multiple chances to pass judgment on the speaker s decision. Are you disappointed Paul Ryan has endorsed him? Blitzer asked. I wish everybody in the Republican Party had rejected Mr. Trump and chosen someone else, Romney said. But my choice is different than that of the other people, and I m certainly not going to argue with them about their choice. Sanders to meet with top supporters to discuss campaign s future Romney also shared some disappointment in the Republican candidates who wooed him fervently for support, saying they largely shied away from a fight with Trump in the primary. For much of the campaign, Republican candidates squabbled to position themselves as the chief Trump alternative. I don t think he got the scrutiny applied to him that is typically applied to a front runner by the people running against him, he said, lamenting that they were firing at each other. Jeb Bush had a super PAC of over million. And they focused their fire on Marco Rubio and others, as opposed to focusing it on the front runner. But if Romney had ran? Had I been in the race, he said, I can assure you, I would have taken him on. ",

But the Kasich campaign released a Web ad Tuesday directly attacked Trump with a darker tone than any other candidate has used so far to go after the business mogul. The spot features retired Air Force Col. Tom Moe speaking at an event in Ohio, the same day Trump held a rally in Columbus. Moe, who the Kasich campaign identifies as a former Vietnam POW, paraphrases a quote from Protestant pastor Martin Niem ller, taken from his lectures after World War II. You might not care if Donald Trump says Muslims should register with their government, because you re not one, says Moe, to an ominous soundtrack. And you might not care if Donald Trump says he s going to round up all the Hispanic immigrants, because you re not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump says it s okay to rough up black protesters, because you re not one. And you might not care if Donald Trump wants to suppress journalists, because you re not one. But think about this If he keeps going, and he actually becomes president, he might just get around to you. And you better hope there s someone left to help you.

        "text": " Why Is Clinton disliked? Why the hate for Hillary? Why do people hate Hillary Clinton so much? Is it because of partisanship? Or a hard fought primary? Maybe, NBC once suggested, it s because she s not a train wreck. Funny how the answers seem to be everything but the obvious. We go on endlessly about how untrustworthy she is, while fact checkers rank her as the second most honest prominent politician in the country. And her opponent as by far the least. We say that she has trouble with transparency, while her opponent refuses to release his taxes and the current administration sets records for secrecy. We decry her ties to corporations and the financial industry, while supporting a walking tax shelter or mourning the exit of a president whose re election was funded by a record shattering Wall Street haul. We list so very many explanations, all of them complete bullshit. In truth, the Hillary haters seem to resent her more than disagree with her. They demand to be humored and catered to. They hold her to wildly different standards than her male counterparts. They regard her with an unprecedented degree of suspicion. Above all, they really, really want to see her punished. And an aggressive male presence even if dangerously incompetent seems to comfort a great many of them. Everyone but them knows damn well why. Bad news for the haters History is decidedly unafraid of the woman card. It doesn t care how many people will stand on tables today and swear they d feel the same if she were a man. It will see us for what we are a sick society, driven by misogyny and pathetically struggling to come to terms with the fact that women do not exist solely to nurture. If that answer isn t as nuanced as the average thinkpiece, that s because we, as a people, are not. No matter how many branches have formed, they all emerged from the same seed, planted way back when Bill Clinton first ran for governor. She wouldn t be so suspicious of the press, or so measured in her presentation, or so any one of a thousand other things, if she had been born a man. The lengths we go to in order to rationalize this all will be seen, in retrospect, as extraordinary. When the Bush administration was discovered to have erased millions of emails illegally sent by administration officials through private, RNC owned accounts, in order to thwart an investigation into the politically motivated firing of eight US attorneys, just one talk show covered it that Sunday. When Mitt Romney wiped servers, sold government hard drives to his closest aides and spent , in taxpayer money to destroy his administration s emails, it was barely an issue. When Hillary Clinton asked Colin Powell how he managed to use a Blackberry while serving as Secretary of State, he replied by detailing his method of intentionally bypassing federal record keeping laws I didn t have a Blackberry. What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line sounds ancient. So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers. I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels. ... There is a real danger. If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it sic government and you are using it, government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Yet the fact that Hillary Clinton emailed through a private server and didn t use it to cover anything up is somehow the defining issue of her campaign. My God, people cry, anyone else would be in jail! Or is the real scandal that her family runs but does not profit from a charitable foundation awarded an A grade by Charity Watch, a four out of four star rating by Charity Navigator and responsible for helping million people in countries get things like clean drinking water and HIV medication? Because the AP seems super concerned that she encountered people who donated to it specifically Nobel Peace Prize winning economist Muhammad Yunus in her official capacity as Secretary of State. It should at this point be observed that her opponent is a shameless con artist who has built an empire bilking people with fake businesses, fake universities, fake charities and, now, a fake campaign. Last week, he told a lie every three minutes and fifteen seconds. Oh, and did we mention that he, like so many of his online supporters, is a goddamn Russian stooge? I tried to list all of the dumb, awful stuff that he does every day and I cannot come close to keeping up. Voters, it seems, are his easiest marks yet. And it isn t just Republicans. The double standards are even more transparent on the left. Back in the mid s, Clinton s persistent unwillingness to hide the fact that she was a thinking human female really freaked the center left establishment out. Michael Moore observed that, Maureen Dowd is fixated on trashing Hillary Rodham in the way liberals love to do, to prove they re not really liberal. The bashing slowly morphed into a creepy, extraordinary sort of policing. Since then, Clinton racked up a Senate voting record more liberal than any nominee since Mondale. Her platform was slightly to Obama s left on domestic issues. Her platform was barely to the right of self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders. Yet, we have all heard and seen countless liberal posers passionately decrying her far right voting record, untrustworthy promises or ever changing policy positions. Jon Stewart recently called Clinton a bright woman without the courage of her convictions, because I don t know what they even are. Because if he doesn t know, she must not have any, right? In fact, there is a very lengthy trail of public records all pointing in the same direction. If you can t figure out which, maybe the problem is you. Yet, many on the left who gladly voted for John Kerry, two years after he voted to authorize the Iraq war, now say they couldn t possibly vote for Clinton, because she did, too. And view her with contempt for opposing same sex marriage in , while fawning over men like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders, who held the same position at the same time. It s time to stop pretending that this is about substance. This is about an eagerness to believe that a woman who seeks power will say or do anything to get it. This is about a Lady MacBeth stereotype that, frankly, should never have existed in the first place. This is about the one thing no one wants to admit it s about. Consider, for a moment, two people. One, as a young woman at the beginning of a promising legal career, went door to door searching for ways to guarantee an education to the countless disabled and disadvantaged children who had fallen through the cracks. The other, as a young millionaire, exacted revenge on his recently deceased brother s family by cutting off the medical insurance desperately needed by his nephew s newborn son, who at eighteen months of age was suffering from violent seizures brought on by a rare neurological disorder. What kind of a society treats these two people as equal in any way? What kind of society even considers the latter over the former for its highest office? Generations from now, people will shake their heads at this moment in time, when the first female major party presidential nominee competent, qualified and more thoroughly vetted than any non incumbent candidate in history endured the humiliation of being likened to such an obvious grifter, ignoramus and hate monger. We deserve the shame that we will bear.",

        "text": "We live in a big, diverse society. There are essentially two ways to maintain order and get things done in such a society politics or some form of dictatorship. Either through compromise or brute force. Our founding fathers chose politics. Politics is an activity in which you recognize the simultaneous existence of different groups, interests and opinions. You try to find some way to balance or reconcile or compromise those interests, or at least a majority of them. You follow a set of rules, enshrined in a constitution or in custom, to help you reach these compromises in a way everybody considers legitimate. The downside of politics is that people never really get everything they want. It s messy, limited and no issue is ever really settled. Politics is a muddled activity in which people have to recognize restraints and settle for less than they want. Disappointment is normal. But that s sort of the beauty of politics, too. It involves an endless conversation in which we learn about other people and see things from their vantage point and try to balance their needs against our own. Plus, it s better than the alternative rule by some authoritarian tyrant who tries to govern by clobbering everyone in his way. As Bernard Crick wrote in his book, In Defence of Politics, Politics is a way of ruling divided societies without undue violence. Over the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics. These groups best exemplified by the Tea Party but not exclusive to the right want to elect people who have no political experience. They want outsiders. They delegitimize compromise and deal making. They re willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision making if it helps them gain power. Ultimately, they don t recognize other people. They suffer from a form of political narcissism, in which they don t accept the legitimacy of other interests and opinions. They don t recognize restraints. They want total victories for themselves and their doctrine. This antipolitics tendency has had a wretched effect on our democracy. It has led to a series of overlapping downward spirals The antipolitics people elect legislators who have no political skills or experience. That incompetence leads to dysfunctional government, which leads to more disgust with government, which leads to a demand for even more outsiders. The antipolitics people don t accept that politics is a limited activity. They make soaring promises and raise ridiculous expectations. When those expectations are not met, voters grow cynical and, disgusted, turn even further in the direction of antipolitics. The antipolitics people refuse compromise and so block the legislative process. The absence of accomplishment destroys public trust. The decline in trust makes deal making harder. We re now at a point where the Senate says it won t even hold hearings on a presidential Supreme Court nominee, in clear defiance of custom and the Constitution. We re now at a point in which politicians live in fear if they try to compromise and legislate. We re now at a point in which normal political conversation has broken down. People feel unheard, which makes them shout even louder, which further destroys conversation. And in walks Donald Trump. People say that Trump is an unconventional candidate and that he represents a break from politics as usual. That s not true. Trump is the culmination of the trends we have been seeing for the last years the desire for outsiders the bashing style of rhetoric that makes conversation impossible the decline of coherent political parties the declining importance of policy the tendency to fight cultural battles and identity wars through political means. Trump represents the path the founders rejected. There is a hint of violence undergirding his campaign. There is always a whiff, and sometimes more than a whiff, of I d like to punch him in the face. I printed out a Times list of the insults Trump has hurled on Twitter. The list took up pages. Trump s style is bashing and pummeling. Everyone who opposes or disagrees with him is an idiot, a moron or a loser. The implied promise of his campaign is that he will come to Washington and bully his way through. Trump s supporters aren t looking for a political process to address their needs. They are looking for a superhero. As the political scientist Matthew MacWilliams found, the one trait that best predicts whether you re a Trump supporter is how high you score on tests that measure authoritarianism. This isn t just an American phenomenon. Politics is in retreat and authoritarianism is on the rise worldwide. The answer to Trump is politics. It s acknowledging other people exist. It s taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements. As Harold Laski put it, We shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement. Therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony. ",

        "text": "Like any number of us raised in the late th century, I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany. Watching Donald Trump s rise, I now understand. Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate. That is not my point. My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country. To understand the rise of Hitler and the spread of Nazism, I have generally relied on the German Jewish migr philosopher Hannah Arendt and her arguments about the banality of evil. Somehow people can understand themselves as just doing their job, yet act as cogs in the wheel of a murderous machine. Arendt also offered a second answer in a small but powerful book called Men in Dark Times. In this book, she described all those who thought that Hitler s rise was a terrible thing but chose internal exile, or staying invisible and out of the way as their strategy for coping with the situation. They knew evil was evil, but they too facilitated it, by departing from the battlefield out of a sense of hopelessness. One can see both of these phenomena unfolding now. The first shows itself, for instance, when journalists cover every crude and cruel thing that comes out of Trump s mouth and thereby help acculturate all of us to what we are hearing. Are they not just doing their jobs, they will ask, in covering the Republican front runner? Have we not already been acculturated by years of popular culture to offensive and inciting comments? Yes, both of these things are true. But that doesn t mean journalists ought to be Trump s megaphone. Perhaps we should just shut the lights out on offensiveness turn off the mic when someone tries to shout down others reestablish standards for what counts as a worthwhile contribution to the public debate. That will seem counter to journalistic norms, yes, but why not let Trump pay for his own ads when he wants to broadcast foul and incendiary ideas? He ll still have plenty of access to freedom of expression. It is time to draw a bright line. How Donald Trump won the South Carolina GOP primary, in seconds Play Video Donald Trump won the Feb. South Carolina GOP primary. Here s how. Peter Stevenson The Washington Post One spots the second experience in any number of water cooler conversations or dinner party dialogues. Yes, yes, it is terrible. Can you believe it? Have you seen anything like it? Has America come to this? Agreed, agreed. But when someone asks what is to be done, silence falls. Very many of us, too many of us, are starting to contemplate accepting internal exile. Or we joke about moving to Canada more seriously than usually. But over the course of the past few months, I ve learned something else that goes beyond Arendt s ideas about the banality of evil and feelings of impotence in the face of danger. Trump is rising by taking advantage of a divided country. The truth is that the vast majority of voting Americans think that Trump is unacceptable as a presidential candidate, but we are split by strong partisan ideologies and cannot coordinate a solution to stop him. Similarly, a significant part of voting Republicans think that Trump is unacceptable, but they too, thus far, have been unable to coordinate a solution. Trump is exploiting the fact that we cannot unite across our ideological divides. The only way to stop him, then, is to achieve just that kind of coordination across party lines and across divisions within parties. We have reached that moment of truth. Republicans, you cannot count on the Democrats to stop Trump. I believe that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination, and I intend to vote for her, but it is also the case that she is a candidate with significant weaknesses, as your party knows quite well. The result of a head to head contest between Clinton and Trump would be unpredictable. Trump has to be blocked in your primary. Jeb Bush has done the right thing by dropping out, just as he did the right thing by being the first, alongside Rand Paul, to challenge Trump. The time has come, John Kasich and Ben Carson, to leave the race as well. You both express a powerful commitment to the good of your country and to its founding ideals. If you care about the future of this republic, it is time to endorse Marco Rubio. Kasich, there s a little wind in your sails, but it s not enough. Your country is calling you. Do the right thing. Ted Cruz is, I believe, pulling votes away from Trump, and for that reason is useful in the race. But, Mr. Cruz, you are drawing too close to Trump s politics. You too should change course. Democrats, your leading candidate is too weak to count on as a firewall. She might be able to pull off a general election victory against Trump, but then again she might not. Too much is uncertain this year. You, too, need to help the Republicans beat Trump this is no moment for standing by passively. If your deadline for changing your party affiliation has not yet come, re register and vote for Rubio, even if, like me, you cannot stomach his opposition to marriage equality. I too would prefer Kasich as the Republican nominee, but pursuing that goal will only make it more likely that Trump takes the nomination. The republic cannot afford that. Finally, to all of you Republicans who have already dropped out, one more, great act of public service awaits you. As candidates, you pledged to support whomever the Republican party nominated. It s time to revoke your pledge. Be bold, stand up and shout that you will not support Trump if he is your party s nominee. Do it together. Hold one big mother of a news conference. Endorse Rubio, together. It is time to draw a bright line, and you are the ones on whom this burden falls. No one else can do it. Marco Rubio, this is also your moment to draw a bright line. You too ought to rescind your pledge to support the party s nominee if it is Trump. Donald Trump has no respect for the basic rights that are the foundation of constitutional democracy, nor for the requirements of decency necessary to sustain democratic citizenship. Nor can any democracy survive without an expectation that the people require reasonable arguments that bring the truth to light, and Trump has nothing but contempt for our intelligence. We, the people, need to find somewhere, buried in the recesses of our fading memories, the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared liberties. The time is now.",

        "text": "Some time ago, Hillary Clinton and her advisers decided that the best course of action was to apologize for having used a personal email address to conduct government business while serving as secretary of state. Clinton herself was, clearly, not really all that remorseful about this, and it showed in her early efforts to address it. Eventually aides prevailed upon her to express a greater degree of regret, which they hoped would lay the issue to rest. It did not. Instead, email related talk has dogged Clinton throughout the election and it has influenced public perceptions of her in an overwhelmingly negative way. July polling showed percent of Americans believed Clinton broke the law by relying on a personal email address with another percent piling on to say the episode showed bad judgments albeit not criminality. Because Clinton herself apologized for it and because it does not appear to be in any way important, Clinton allies, surrogates, and co partisans have largely not familiarized themselves with the details of the matter, instead saying vaguely that it was an error of judgment and she apologized and America has bigger fish to fry. This has had the effect of further inscribing and reinscribing the notion that Clinton did something wrong, meaning that every bit of micro news that puts the scandal back on cable amounts to reminding people of something bad that Clinton did. In total, network newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clinton s emails than to all policy issues combined. This is unfortunate because emailgate, like so many Clinton pseudo scandals before it, is bullshit. The real scandal here is the way a story that was at best of modest significance came to dominate the US presidential election overwhelming stories of much more importance, giving the American people a completely skewed impression of one of the two nominees, and creating space for the FBI to intervene in the election in favor of its apparently preferred candidate in a dangerous way. Why Hillary Clinton used a personal email account When Hillary Clinton took office as secretary of state, she, like most people, already had a personal email account. Like most people who started a federal job in , she was also disheartened to learn that the then current state of federal IT departments was such that she could not connect her personal smartphone to a State Department email address. If she wanted ready access to both her email accounts, she would need to carry two smartphones. As any reporter in Washington knows, this indignity was in fact visited upon a huge number of DC denizens for many years. Everyone working in government felt that this was kinda bullshit, but nobody could really do anything about it. Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts has opined that carrying two phones could be reasonable grounds to suspect someone is a drug dealer. Clinton decided to do something about it. Namely, she told her top aides to just email her at her personal address so she could keep using whichever devices she wanted. This violated an internal State Department policy directive, known as a Foreign Affairs Manual, which stated that while it was okay to use personal digital devices to do work occasionally, normal day to day operations should be conducted on standard State Department equipment. Clinton chose to ignore this guideline and because she was the boss nobody could stop her. Career foreign service officers and other State personnel have every right to be peeved that Clinton opted out of an annoying policy rather than fixing the underlying issue, but it s hardly a matter of overwhelming public concern. And, indeed, it turns out Colin Powell also used a private email address for routine work. Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright didn t use email, and back before Albright only weird nerds even knew what email was. So at the time Clinton took office, only one previous secretary of state had ever faced the question of what email account to use, and he reached the exact same conclusion Clinton did just use your personal email address. Why Hillary used a private email server When Hillary tried the eminently sensible I was following precedent defense, Politifact dinged her answer as mostly false on the grounds that while Powell did use a personal email account, he didn t use a private email server. This distinction has attracted a lot of attention. And it s proven politically damaging because while lots of people maintain two email addresses and sometimes do work stuff on their personal email, very few Americans use a private email server as opposed to relying on a commercial email service. But legally speaking, this is completely irrelevant. As the State Department inspector general concluded in its report on Clinton s conduct, the guideline Clinton violated was a principle that normal day to day operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated Information System. Using a private server violates that rule, but so would using a Gmail address or simply checking your State.gov email address from your personal laptop rather than a Department issue one. But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant, it s certainly unusual. And it leaves people wondering Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server? Clinton, as you may have heard, is married to former president Bill Clinton, who stepped down from office in January of . Clinton was in the White House throughout the s when the rest of us were being bombarded with AOL signup CD ROMs, so he didn t have a personal email when he left. Gmail didn t exist back then, and his new job was, in effect, running a Bill Clinton startup. He launched a charitable foundation, he established his presidential library, and he made big bucks on speaking tours. He had a staff and he needed IT infrastructure and support. So he paid a guy to set up an email server that he could use. Hillary Clinton who is, again, his wife also set herself up with an account on the same server. This is a bit unusual, but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual. What it s not is suspicious. The private server was not a transparency dodge It s become a bit of an article of faith among journalists frustrated with public officials constant FOIA dodging that this is all obviously dissimulation and Clinton was really trying to evade the Freedom of Information Act. Many people, for example, point to the fact that Clinton would routinely travel with multiple digital devices as debunking her supposed convenience argument. But this is silly. I ve been known to travel with an iPhone, an iPad, a Kindle, and a laptop all at once. That doesn t mean needing to carry two separate iPhones one to check my work email and one to check my personal email wouldn t be inconvenient. After all, what if I was replying to a work email while a text came in to my personal phone and I wanted to check it. I d be left juggling phones and looking like an idiot, exactly how federal employees tended to look in the heyday of the double fisting phones era. I would not want to do that. Colin Powell did not want to do that. Hillary Clinton did not want to do that. Because that would be terrible. By contrast, it s a terrible solution to a desire to avoid having your emails disclosed to the public via FOIA. One way you can tell it s a terrible solution is that Hillary Clinton s work emails have been disclosed to the public. You can read them right here. The specific timeline is that the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested Clinton s emails in the summer of , at which point the relevant State Department personnel realized they did not have the emails because Clinton had been using her personal address. State asked Clinton for the emails, and she handed them over later that year. It was only in March of that the New York Times broke the story of Clinton s personal email account in a scoop by Michael Schmidt the server was reported a few days later by the AP , which reported that the emails had been handed over to the State Department two months ago. This is fairly clearly not an optimal approach to government record keeping, as Thomas Blanton of the National Security Archive at George Washington University told Schmidt at the time It s a shame it didn t take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have. Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back. Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment. According to the Inspector General s report, Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary. There are two possible interpretations here. One is that Clinton hatched the private email account plan as an elaborate dodge of federal record keeping laws, but then months before the public became aware of the server s existence complied with requests to turn them over. The other is that the federal records rule on the book was antiquated and a bit absurd, requiring officials to turn over paper copies of emails for no good reason, and simply got ignored out of sloppiness. But she deleted , emails! Suspicion at this point is then supposed to focus on the fact that she had her lawyers delete more than , emails from her server. After Hillary left office, the State Department told her she had to turn all her work related emails over to them, so she tasked a legal team with determining which emails were work emails and which were not. She turned the work emails over because that s what she was legally required to do. She deleted the others, presumably because she did not want Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz to rummage through her inbox leaking whatever they happened to find amusing to area journalists. Now, is it possible that Clinton s legal team simply decided to entirely disregard the law and delete work related emails? In some sense, sure. But there s no evidence that this happened. Generally speaking, in life we assume it would be moderately difficult to hire a well known law firm to destroy evidence for you without someone deciding to do the right thing and squeal. Besides which, it would be almost comically easy to catch Clinton in the act of systematically destroying relevant emails. The vast majority of the work related email correspondence of an incumbent secretary of state, after all, is going to be correspondence with other government employees. Maybe she shoots a note to the Pentagon about Benghazi, or circulates ideas for a speech draft with her communications team. Any message like that, by definition, would exist on a government server as well as on her private one. This means it would be fully accessible via FOIA and also means that if Clinton s copy were found to not be in the pile of emails she turned over, she d be caught red handed. The available FOIA workarounds are available to everyone Now what s true is that Clinton could, in theory, have conducted work related email conversations using another person s personal email address. She could, for instance, have emailed Jake Sullivan on his Gmail address then deleted the email from her private server. We d be in the dark and she d get away with it. The key thing to note here, however, is that the availability of this option has nothing to do with Clinton s decision to use a personal account as her exclusive account and also has nothing to do with her decision to host her personal email on a private server. At any given time, any federal employee can use her personal account to email any other federal employee at his personal account. If they receive a Freedom of Information Act request, they are legally obligated to hand that correspondence over. But in a practical sense, if they want to break the law they can probably get away with it. And as Ezra Klein has noted, there are a lot of workarounds here As every reporter knows, when official sources want to tell you something particularly delicate, they email you from a personal account or, much more often, they call. A lot of my reporting happens by email. But virtually none of my reporting with the White House happens by email. There, emails for clarification, or comment, quickly lead to phone calls. The reason unsaid but obvious is that phone calls don t leave an official record. White House officials can talk freely on the phone in a way they can t over email. Similarly, the White House keeps a visitor s log. If you make an appointment to meet with someone, your entrance and point of contact are recorded for posterity and searchable online. When someone who shouldn t be meeting with you wants to meet with you, they tend to suggest an off site location a restaurant downtown, or a nearby coffee shop. Peet s Coffee doesn t keep a list of everyone who walks in or out. We do not, however, generally treat all federal employees as having a massive ethical cloud over their heads just because they could probably use this workaround to break the law. There is zero reason to apply heightened scrutiny to Clinton just because she also could break the law. Besides which, when you are secretary of state there is a much simpler and easier way to mask your correspondence classification. Here, for example, is an email Sullivan sent to Clinton on June , , that was duly handed over to the State Department and made available by the FOIA office I m not saying the contents of that message don t deserve to be redacted for security purposes. The fact is that I have no idea. But the reality is the American national security state is really, really good at using official channels to avoid disclosure of information. Nobody needs a private email server to pull that off. Indeed, the allegation that the server setup was an elaborate con to evade transparency law is doubly ridiculous. On the one hand, a private server would not be necessary to carry it out. All you need is to have a private email address on the side, which everyone does. While on the other hand, the exclusive use of a personal email account means that Clinton s personal account has come under an exceptional level of security. The classification thing is a red herring It s precisely because nothing about the basic setup of the email account was in any way wrong that the investigation ended up focusing on the question of mishandling classified information. The key point here is that using a State.gov email account would not have changed anything. When US government officials have conversations about classified matters, they are not supposed to use email. They are supposed to use special secure channels. Nonetheless, mistakes happen in part because classification standards are vague and ever changing. Technically speaking, forwarding a Washington Post article detailing things revealed by Edward Snowden could constitute an improper discussion of classified matters. As FBI Director James Comey concluded, no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against Clinton over this matter. Almost all of the relevant statutes require an intent to mishandle classified information in order to bring a prosecution, a standard that Clinton s conduct clearly does not meet. Critics have thus chosen to focus on USC , a statute that sets a lower gross negligence standard. However, as Jack Goldsmith, one of the top lawyers in George W. Bush s administration explains, such a prosecution would be entirely novel, and would turn in part on very tricky questions about how email exchanges fit into language written with physical removal of classified information in mind. Ben Wittes, a veteran legal journalist and Brookings fellow who has spent the past several years specializing in national security law, wrote that Comey s characterization was clearly correct For the last several months, people have been asking me what I thought the chances of an indictment were. I have said each time that there is no chance without evidence of bad faith action of some kind. People simply don t get indicted for accidental, non malicious mishandling of classified material. I have followed leak cases for a very long time, both at the Washington Post and since starting Lawfare. I have never seen a criminal matter proceed without even an allegation of something more than mere mishandling of sensitive information. Hillary Clinton is not above the law, but to indict her on these facts, she d have to be significantly below the law. It s true that to a layman the Espionage Act s reference to gross negligence sounds similar to Comey s characterization of Clinton s actions as extremely careless. But as Philip Zelikow, a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration and currently the Director of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia explains, they only sound alike unless you do a tiny bit of homework on the history and caselaw of the Statute. Did Hillary Clinton do something criminal with her emails? Philip Zelikow walks you through. election AnnCompton pastpunditry pic.twitter.com kS Z dq Qf Miller Center Miller Center November , As the Cato Institute s Julian Sanchez writes, attempting a prosecution for non malicious mishandling would likely result in the statute being held unconstitutional the Supreme Court s opinion in Gorin v. United States , which suggests that the Espionage Act s intent requirements are an important feature that save it from unconstitutional vagueness. This legal analysis is important because it makes it clear that even if the Weiner laptop emails aren t simply client side copies of the exact emails the FBI already has, there is essentially no chance it will change the ultimate verdict. The reason Clinton isn t getting locked up is that there was no malign intent. Finding another email with classified information on it won t change that conclusion. A bullshit scandal amidst a serious election Network newscasts have, remarkably, dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clinton s emails than to all policy issues combined. Cable news has been, if anything, worse, and many prestige outlets have joined the pileup. One malign result of obsessive email coverage is that the public is left totally unaware of the policy stakes in the election. Another is that the constant vague recitations of the phrase Clinton email scandal have firmly implanted the notion that there is something scandalous about anything involving Hillary Clinton and email, including her campaign manager getting hacked or the revelation that one of her aides sometimes checked mail on her husband s computer. But none of this is true. Clinton broke no laws according to the FBI itself. Her setup gave her no power to evade federal transparency laws beyond what anyone who has a personal email account of any kind has. Her stated explanation for her conduct is entirely believable, fits the facts perfectly, and is entirely plausible to anyone who doesn t simply start with the assumption that she s guilty of something. Given Powell s conduct, Clinton wasn t even breaking with an informal precedent. The very worst you can say is that, faced with an annoying government IT policy, she used her stature to find a personal workaround rather than a systemic fix that would work for everyone. To spend so much time on such a trivial matter would be absurd in a city council race, much less a presidential election. To do so in circumstances when it advances the electoral prospects of a rival who has shattered all precedents in terms of lacking transparency or basic honesty is infinitely more scandalous than anything related to the server itself.",

        "text": "The American media, over the past year, has been trying to work out something of a mystery Why is the Republican electorate supporting a far right, orange toned populist with no real political experience, who espouses extreme and often bizarre views? How has Donald Trump, seemingly out of nowhere, suddenly become so popular? What s made Trump s rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines education, income, age, even religiosity that usually demarcate candidates. And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base, such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates, Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York, and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses. Table of contents I. What is American authoritarianism? II. The discovery III. How authoritarianism works IV. What can authoritarianism explain? V. The party of authoritarians VI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear VII. America s changing social landscape VIII. What authoritarians want IX. How authoritarians will change American politics Perhaps strangest of all, it wasn t just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere, suddenly expressing, in large numbers, ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory. In South Carolina, a CBS News exit poll found that percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States. A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country. Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldn t have freed the slaves. Last September, a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteries. MacWilliams studies authoritarianism not actual dictators, but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders. People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear. So MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for Trump. He polled a large sample of likely voters, looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism. What he found was astonishing Not only did authoritarianism correlate, but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator. He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina, shortly before the primary there, and found the same results, which he published in Vox As it turns out, MacWilliams wasn t the only one to have this realization. Miles away, in an office at Vanderbilt University, a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment. He realized that he and a fellow political scientist, the University of North Carolina s Jonathan Weiler, had essentially predicted Trump s rise back in , when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realized. That year, Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics. Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis, they had come to a surprising conclusion Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oft cited variables, but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group authoritarians. Their book concluded that the GOP, by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order, had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendencies. This trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration, which activated authoritarian tendencies, leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alien. Trump embodies the classic authoritarian leadership style simple, powerful, and punitive These Americans with authoritarian views, they found, were sorting into the GOP, driving polarization. But they were also creating a divide within the party, at first latent, between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and, often, more extreme. Over time, Hetherington and Weiler had predicted, that sorting would become more and more pronounced. And so it was all but inevitable that, eventually, authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heard. At the time, even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications that their theory, when followed to its natural conclusion, predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics. But looking back now, the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear. Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate, to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change, and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force. They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things. And the extreme nature of authoritarians fears, and of their desire to challenge threats with force, would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms. A candidate like Donald Trump. Donald Trump Scott Olson Getty Images Even Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been. In the early fall of , as Trump s rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists, he called Weiler. He asked, over and over, Can you believe this? Can you believe this? This winter, I got in touch with Hetherington, MacWilliams, and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism. I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted, with such eerie accuracy, Trump s rise. And, like them, I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics. Was Trump just the start of something bigger? These political scientists were, at that moment, beginning to grapple with the same question. We agreed there was something important happening here that was just beginning to be understood. Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics Shortly after the Iowa Republican caucus, in which Trump came in a close second, Vox partnered with the Washington based media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the field. What we found is a phenomenon that explains, with remarkable clarity, the rise of Donald Trump but that is also much larger than him, shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade. Trump, it turns out, is just the symptom. The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics, with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this election. I. What is American authoritarianism? A Trump supporter carries a sign saying Build the wall Andrew Renneisen Getty Images For years now, before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary, a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question, part political science and part psychology, that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the Nazis. How do people come to adopt, in such large numbers and so rapidly, extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leader? To answer that question, these theorists study what they call authoritarianism not the dictators themselves, but rather the psychological profile of people who, under the right conditions, will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them. The political phenomenon we identify as right wing populism seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed After an early period of junk science in the mid th century, a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question, specifically studying how it plays out in American politics researchers like Hetherington and Weiler, Stanley Feldman, Karen Stenner, and Elizabeth Suhay, to name just a few. The field, after a breakthrough in the early s, has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism, culminating quite recently, in , with Stenner s seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic just in time for that theory to seemingly come true, more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined, in the personage of one Donald Trump and his norm shattering rise. According to Stenner s theory, there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies. These tendencies can be triggered or activated by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change, leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarian. It is as if, the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written, a button is pushed that says, In case of moral threat, lock down the borders, kick out those who are different, and punish those who are morally deviant. Authoritarians are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump and will persist as a force in American politics Authoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies, which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world. Challenges to that order diversity, influx of outsiders, breakdown of the old order are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic security. This is, after all, a time of social change in America. The country is becoming more diverse, which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before. Those changes have been happening for a long time, but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore. And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed working class white people. When they face physical threats or threats to the status quo, authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears. They favor forceful, decisive action against things they perceive as threats. And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this action. If you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians, and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters, the result would look a lot like Donald Trump. But political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump, placing him within larger trends in American politics polarization, the rightward shift of the Republican Party, and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politics. More than that, authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics. And it suggest that a combination of demographic, economic, and political forces, by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump, have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP a phenomenon that broke into public view with the election but will persist long after it has ended. II. The discovery how a niche subfield of political science suddenly became some of the most relevant research in American politics Buttons for sale on the day of the Iowa caucuses Brendan Hoffman Getty Images Buttons for sale on the day of the Iowa caucuses. This study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II, as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideology. That was a worthy field of study, but the early work wasn t particularly rigorous by today s standards. The critical theorist Theodor Adorno, for instance, developed what he called the F scale, which sought to measure fascist tendencies. The test wasn t accurate. Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the right answers were and game the test. And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascism. More than that, this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong, and that they resist in their work. They acknowledge the label authoritarians doesn t do much to dispel this, but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorative sounding term were unsuccessful. If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump s ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics? But the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile, how do you measure it? How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies, which can sometimes be latent? How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicized? As Hetherington explained to me, There are certain things that you just can t ask people directly. You can t ask people, Do you not like black people? You can t ask people if they re bigots. For a long time, no one had a solution for this, and the field of study languished. Then in the early s, a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything. Feldman, a professor at SUNY Stonybrook, believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism, but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferences. He realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference, he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial. He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable parenting goals. Feldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy, order, and conformity over other values. Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have independence or respect for elders? Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have obedience or self reliance? Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have to be considerate or to be well behaved? Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have curiosity or good manners? Feldman s test proved to be very reliable. There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile, by prizing order and conformity, for example, and desiring the imposition of those values. In , Feldman convinced the National Election Study, a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year, to include his four authoritarianism questions. Ever since, political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferences. What they found was impossible to ignore and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorate. III. How authoritarianism works A Tea Party supporter holds a sign asking Obama where s your papers Justin Sullivan Getty Images A protest against President Obama. In the early s, as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics, their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump, but seemingly a half century of American political dynamics. The first was Hetherington and Weiler s insight into partisan polarization. In the s, the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law, order, and traditional values a position that naturally appealed to order and tradition focused authoritarians. Over the decades that followed, authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP, where their concentration gave them more and more influence over time. The second was Stenner s theory of activation. In an influential book called The Authoritarian Dynamic, Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been activated. The social threat theory helps explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them This activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity, or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect. In response, previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call Trump esque. Other researchers, like Hetherington, take a slightly different view. They believe that authoritarians aren t activated they ve always held their authoritarian preferences but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsiders. But both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism. People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism, but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats. The third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay, who found that when non authoritarians feel sufficiently scared, they also start to behave, politically, like authoritarians. But Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism, which could lead non authoritarians to behave like authoritarians, and more abstract social threats, such as eroding social norms or demographic changes, which do not have that effect. That distinction would turn out to be important, but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats, the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly. Together, those three insights added up to one terrifying theory that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time, it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians, who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary, in their view, to meet the rising threats. This theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in . Beyond being almost alarmingly prescient, this theory speaks to an oft stated concern about Trump that what s scariest is not the candidate, but rather the extent and fervor of his support. And it raises a question If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump s ascent, then how else might it be shaping American politics? And what effect could it have even after the race has ended? IV. What can authoritarianism explain? Trump greets supporters in Alabama Mark Wallheiser Getty Images In early February, shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support, I began talking to Feldman, Hetherington, and MacWilliams to try to answer these questions. MacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump. But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life, from policy positions to party politics to social issues, and what it might mean for America s future. It was time to call Kyle Dropp. Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as the Doogie Howser of polling. He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor. But he is also the co founder of a media and polling company, Morning Consult, that had worked with Vox on several other projects. When we approached Morning Consult, Dropp and his colleagues were excited. Dropp was familiar with Hetherington s work and the authoritarianism measure, he said, and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election. Hetherington and the other political scientists were, in turn, eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevant. Non authoritarians who were sufficiently frightened of threats like terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians We put together five sets of questions. The first set, of course, was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed. This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didn t with our other sets of questions. The second set asked standard election season questions on preferred candidates and party affiliation. The third set tested voters fears of a series of physical threats, ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidents. The fourth set tested policy preferences, in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policies. If the research were right, then we d expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of outsider threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats. We also expected that non authoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump. This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge, which would in turn lead to Trump support. We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election The final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change. We asked people to rate a series of social changes both actual and hypothetical on a scale of very good to very bad for the country. These included same sex marriage, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and American Muslims building more mosques in US cities. If the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct, then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the country. In the aggregate, we were hoping to do a few things. We wanted to understand who these people are, in simple demographic terms, and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism, in theory, is supposed to work. We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election Were they driving certain policy positions, for example? We wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme was it migration, terrorism, perhaps the decline of working class whites? And maybe most of all, we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally divided. About days later, shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, the poll went into the field. In less than two weeks, we had our results. V. How the GOP became the party of authoritarians Donald Trump and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in Texas Tom Pennington Getty Images Donald Trump and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in Texas. The first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are. Our results found that percent of white respondents nationwide scored as high or very high authoritarians, with percent as very high. That s actually not unusual, and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from rare . The key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent people in this percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat, physical or social. But that latency is part of how, over the past few decades, authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing it. Today, according to our survey, authoritarians skew heavily Republican. More than percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters. More than percent of surveyed Republicans scored as high or very high authoritarians. And at the other end of the scale, that pattern reversed. People whose scores were most non authoritarian meaning they always chose the non authoritarian parenting answer were almost percent Democrats. But this hasn t always been the case. According to Hetherington and Weiler s research, this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus. It s a story of polarization that increased over time. They trace the trend to the s, when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats, in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms for example, the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights. The GOP also embraced a law and order platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riots. This positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures a role that it has maintained ever since. That promise to stave off social change and, if necessary, to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinations. Democrats, by contrast, have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights, equality, and social progress in other words, as the party of social change, a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels change averse authoritarians. Over the next several decades, Hetherington explained to me, this led authoritarians to naturally sort themselves into the Republican Party. That matters, because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP, they have more influence over its policies and candidates. It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarian. Perhaps more importantly, the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians voting preferences even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishment. VI. Trump, authoritarians, and fear Based on our data, Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that among Republicans, very high high authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump. Trump has percent support among Republicans but, according to our survey, a full percent support among very high authoritarians. Authoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump, although having a high school education also came close. And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results, the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust, even after controlling for education level and gender. Trump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism only percent. But that s still awfully high. So what could explain Trump s support among non authoritarians? I suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhay s research on how fear affects non authoritarian voters, so I called them to discuss the data. Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two things. The first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threats. Authoritarians, we found in our survey, tend to most fear threats that come from abroad, such as ISIS or Russia or Iran. These are threats, the researchers point out, to which people can put a face a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah. Non authoritarians were much less afraid of those threats. For instance, percent of very high scoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a very high risk to them, but only percent of very low scoring authoritarians did. Domestic threats like car accidents, by contrast, were much less frightening to authoritarians. But Hetherington also noticed something else A subgroup of non authoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS. And the more fear of these threats they expressed, the more likely they were to support Trump. This seemed to confirm his and Suhay s theory that non authoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians. That s important, because for years now, Republican politicians and Republican leaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isn t doing enough to keep Americans safe. There are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens. But the point is that, as a result, Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers. As the perception of physical threat has risen, this fear appears to have led a number of non authoritarians to vote like authoritarians to support Trump. An irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by, among other things, co opting his message. But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trump s rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims, they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to Trump. VII. Is America s changing social landscape activating authoritarianism? But the research on authoritarianism suggests it s not just physical threats driving all this. There should be another kind of threat larger, slower, less obvious, but potentially even more powerful pushing authoritarians to these extremes the threat of social change. This could come in the form of evolving social norms, such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation. It could come in the form of rising diversity, whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV. Or it could be any changes, political or economic, that disrupt social hierarchies. What these changes have in common is that, to authoritarians, they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it familiar, orderly, secure and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing, but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society. According to the literature, authoritarians will seek, in response, a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes, if necessary by force, and to preserve the status quo. This is why, in our survey, we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus non authoritarians expressed a fear of social change and whether this, as expected, led them to desire heavy handed responses. Our results seemed to confirm this Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as bad or very bad for the country. For instance, our results suggested that an astonishing percent of authoritarians believe same sex marriage is harmful to the country. Twenty eight percent rated same sex marriage as very bad for America, and another percent said that it s bad. Only about percent of high scoring authoritarians said same sex marriage was good or very good for the country. Tellingly, non authoritarians responses skewed in the opposite direction. Non authoritarians tended to rate same sex marriage as good or very good for the country. The fact that authoritarians and non authoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as same sex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rights. We also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing. This was intended to test respondents comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election. A whopping . percent of very high scoring authoritarians said it was either bad or very bad for the country when Muslims built more mosques. Only percent of that group said more mosques would be good or very good. The literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as outsiders and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communities. This would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change, such as Muslims or same sex couples or Hispanic migrants, but rather to reject all of them. What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order, which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselves. And America is at a point when the status quo social order is changing rapidly when several social changes are converging. And they are converging especially on working class white people. It is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that working class white Americans are angry. Indeed they are, but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that, according to this research, are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple anger that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responses. Working class communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession. And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted. Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades, owing to migration and other factors. The president is a black man, and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture. Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands, and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concerns. Some of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others the loss of working class jobs in this country is a real and important issue, no matter how one feels about fading white privilege but that is not the point. The point, rather, is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as right wing populism, or white working class populism, seems to line up, with almost astonishing precision, with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed. That is not to dismiss white working class concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics, but rather to better understand why this is happening and why it s having such a profound and extreme effect on American politics. Have we misunderstood hard line social conservatism all along? Most of the other social threat questions followed a similar pattern . On its surface, this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hard line manifestations of social conservatism. But when examined more carefully, it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itself. For liberals, it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like same sex marriage, immigration, and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups that it s the manifestation of specific homophobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia. But the results of the Vox Morning Consult poll, along with prior research on authoritarianism, suggests there might be something else going on. There is no particular reason, after all, why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups. We weren t asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races, but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally. So why do they coincide so heavily? What might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner s theory of activation What is most likely, Hetherington suggested, is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific other whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group. Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threatening. It all depends, he said, on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not whether they had been identified as a dangerous other. Since September , some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America. Authoritarians, by nature, are more susceptible to these messages, and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communities. When told to fear a particular outgroup, Hetherington said, On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like, I m not that worried about that, while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like, Oh, my god! I m worried about that, because the world is a dangerous place. In other words, what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner s theory of activation that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America, and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given moment. That s not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia it is still dangerous and damaging, especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald Trump. Perhaps more to the point, it helps explain how Trump s supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups mass deportation of millions of people, a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US. When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism, in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses, rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries, this starts to make a lot more sense. VIII. What authoritarians want From our parenting questions, we learned who the GOP authoritarians are. From our questions about threats and social change, we learned what s motivating them. But the final set of questions, on policy preferences, might be the most important of all So what? What do authoritarians actually want? The responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences, distinct from GOP orthodoxy. And those preferences mean that, in real and important ways, authoritarians are their own distinct constituency effectively a new political party within the GOP. What stands out from the results, Feldman wrote after reviewing our data, is that authoritarians are most willing to want to use force, to crack down on immigration, and limit civil liberties. This action side of authoritarianism, he believed, was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates. The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats that is most clear among Trump supporters. Authoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically, we found, were highly likely to support five policies Using military force over diplomacy against countries that threaten the United States Changing the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of illegal immigrants Imposing extra airport checks on passengers who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent in order to curb terrorism Requiring all citizens to carry a national ID card at all times to show to a police officer on request, to curb terrorism Allowing the federal government to scan all phone calls for calls to any number linked to terrorism What these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats, physical and social, and, more than that, a desire to meet those threats with severe government action with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality. The scale of the desired response is, in some ways, what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOP. Many Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism, violence, and cultural diversity, but that s not unique to Trump supporters, Feldman told me. It seems to be the action side of authoritarianism the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats that is most clear among Trump supporters, he added. If Trump loses the election, that won t remove the threats and social changes that trigger the action side of authoritarianism This helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time co opting Trump s supporters, even though those supporters immediate policy concerns, such as limiting immigration or protecting national security, line up with party orthodoxy. The real divide is over how far to go in responding. And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policies. Just as striking is what was missing from authoritarians concerns. There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than , per year, for example. And the same was true of support for international trade agreements. These are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies. All groups opposed the tax cuts, and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism. So there is no real divide on these issues. But there is one more factor that our data couldn t capture but is nevertheless important Trump s style. Trump s specific policies aren t the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates. Rather, it s his rhetoric and style. The way he reduces everything to black and white extremes of strong versus weak, greatest versus worst. His simple, direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manage. And, perhaps most importantly, his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening. That s why it s a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pig blood tainted bullets He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he won t let political correctness hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fear. This, Feldman explained to me, is classic authoritarian leadership style simple, powerful, and punitive. IX. How authoritarians will change the GOP and American politics Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz confront Trump during the February GOP debate Michael Ciaglo Pool Getty Images To my surprise, the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasn t about Trump at all. Rather, it was that authoritarians, as a growing presence in the GOP, are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacy. If Trump loses the election, that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the action side of authoritarianism. The authoritarians will still be there. They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong, punitive leadership they desire. And that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics, with potentially profound implications for the country. It would also mean more problems for the GOP. This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for his showy demagoguery, his disregard for core conservative economic values, his divisiveness. We may now have a de facto three party system the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians But while the party may try to match Trump s authoritarian rhetoric, and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims, in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump can. That will be a problem for the party. Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment. The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in , but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war. Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists, leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaotic. Now a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level, with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party. Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP, and thus able to force their will within the party, but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their own. And so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto three party system the Democrats, the GOP establishment, and the GOP authoritarians. And although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition, the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians, and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishment s centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platform. Over time, this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party. It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election. They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections, but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators. The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues, and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policies. And in the meantime, the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger. Norms around gender, sexuality, and race will continue evolving. Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the country s legacy of institutionalized discrimination, pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threatening. The chaos in the Middle East, which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries, shows no sign of improving. Longer term, if current demographic trends continue, white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decades. In the long run, this could mean a GOP that is even more hard line on immigration and on policing, that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups, but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts. It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections, but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning, and perhaps eventually unable to win the White House. For decades, the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change, and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise. But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well and threatens to tear the party apart.",

        "text": "On Monday, Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy. Twenty four hours later, Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide. I m not here to clutch my pearls over Trump s vulgarity what was telling, rather, was the immaturity of the moment, the glee Trump took in his she said it, I didn t game. The media, which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow, delighted in the moment along with him it was funny, and it meant clicks, takes, traffic. But it was more than that. It was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president showing off the demagogue s instinct for amplifying the angriest voice in the mob. It is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump. He s red faced, discursive, funny, angry, strange, unpredictable, and real. He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon. The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id. America s most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show we ve ever seen. It s so fun to watch that it s easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really is. Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory. He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament he s a racist, a sexist, and a demagogue, but he s also a narcissist, a bully, and a dilettante. He lies so constantly and so fluently that it s hard to know if he even realizes he s lying. He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash. Donald Trump Campaigns Across New Hampshire Ahead Of Primary Day Photo by Joe Raedle Getty Images Trump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination. His triumph in a general election is unlikely, but it is far from impossible. He s not a joke and he s not a clown. He s a man who could soon be making decisions of war and peace, who would decide which regulations are enforced and which are lifted, who would be responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices and representing America in the community of nations. This is not political entertainment. This is politics. Trump s path to power has been unnerving. His business is licensing out his own name as a symbol of opulence. He has endured bankruptcies and scandal by bragging his way out of them. He rose to prominence in the Republican Party as a leader of the birther movement. He climbed to the top of the polls in this election by calling Mexicans rapists and killers. He defended a poor debate performance by accusing Megyn Kelly of being on her period. He responded to rival Ted Cruz s surge by calling for a travel ban on Muslims. When two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and said they did it because Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported, he brushed off complaints that he s inspiring violence by saying his supporters are very passionate. Behind Trump s success is an unerring instinct for harnessing anger, resentment, and fear. His view of the economy is entirely zero sum for Americans to win, others must lose. We re going to make America great again, he said in his New Hampshire victory speech, but we re going to do it the old fashioned way. We re going to beat China, Japan, beat Mexico at trade. We re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis. It s not going to happen anymore. Trump answers America s rage with more rage. As the journalist Molly Ball observed, All the other candidates say Americans are angry, and I understand. Trump says, I M angry. Trump doesn t offer solutions so much as he offers villains. His message isn t so much that he ll help you as he ll hurt them. Donald Trump Holds New Hampshire Primary Night Gathering In Manchester Photo by Joe Raedle Getty Images Trump s other gift the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important is his complete lack of shame. It s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics. But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery. Most people feel shame when they re exposed as liars, when they re seen as uninformed, when their behavior is thought cruel, when respected figures in their party condemn their actions, when experts dismiss their proposals, when they are mocked and booed and protested. Trump doesn t. He has the reality television star s ability to operate entirely without shame, and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint. It is the single scariest facet of his personality. It is the one that allows him to go where others won t, to say what others can t, to do what others wouldn t. Trump lives by the reality television trope that he s not here to make friends. But the reason reality television villains always say they re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart, makes them unpredictable and fun to watch. I m not here to make friends is another way of saying, I m not bound by the social conventions of normal people. The rest of us are here to make friends, and it makes us boring, gentle, kind. This, more than his ideology, is why Trump genuinely scares me. There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field. He seems more dovish than neoconservatives like Marco Rubio, and less dismissive of the social safety net than libertarians like Rand Paul. But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump his temperament is so immature, his narcissism so clear, his political base so unique, his reactions so strange, that I honestly have no idea what he would do or what he wouldn t do. When MSNBC s Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin, who kills journalists, political opponents and invades countries, Trump replied, He s running his country, and at least he s a leader, unlike what we have in this country. Later, he clarified that he doesn t actually condone killing journalists, but, he warned the crowd, I do hate them. It s a lie that if you put a frog into a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will simply boil, but it s a fact that if you put the American political system in a room with Trump for long enough we slowly lose track of how noxious he is, or we at least run out of ways to keep repeating it. But tonight is a night to repeat it. There is something scary in Donald Trump. We should fear his rise.",

        "text": "There is a smug style in American liberalism. It has been growing these past decades. It is a way of conducting politics, predicated on the belief that American life is not divided by moral difference or policy divergence not really but by the failure of half the country to know what s good for them. In , the smug style has found expression in media and in policy, in the attitudes of liberals both visible and private, providing a foundational set of assumptions above which a great number of liberals comport their understanding of the world. It has led an American ideology hitherto responsible for a great share of the good accomplished over the past century of our political life to a posture of reaction and disrespect a condescending, defensive sneer toward any person or movement outside of its consensus, dressed up as a monopoly on reason. The smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography. Beginning in the middle of the th century, the working class, once the core of the coalition, began abandoning the Democratic Party. In , in the immediate wake of Franklin Roosevelt, percent of manual laborers voted for Democrats, along with percent of farmers. In , it was percent of working class voters. By , it was percent. The white working class in particular saw even sharper declines. Despite historic advantages with both poor and middle class white voters, by Democrats possessed only a point advantage among poor white voters. Among white voters making between , and , per year, the GOP has taken a point lead. Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt The consequence was a shift in liberalism s intellectual center of gravity. A movement once fleshed out in union halls and little magazines shifted into universities and major press, from the center of the country to its cities and elite enclaves. Minority voters remained, but bereft of the material and social capital required to dominate elite decision making, they were largely excluded from an agenda driven by the new Democratic core the educated, the coastal, and the professional. It is not that these forces captured the party so much as it fell to them. When the laborer left, they remained. The origins of this shift are overdetermined. Richard Nixon bears a large part of the blame, but so does Bill Clinton. The Southern Strategy, yes, but the destruction of labor unions, too. I have my own sympathies, but I do not propose to adjudicate that question here. Suffice it to say, by the s the better part of the working class wanted nothing to do with the word liberal. What remained of the American progressive elite was left to puzzle What happened to our coalition? Why did they abandon us? What s the matter with Kansas? The smug style arose to answer these questions. It provided an answer so simple and so emotionally satisfying that its success was perhaps inevitable the theory that conservatism, and particularly the kind embraced by those out there in the country, was not a political ideology at all. Learn more How politics makes us stupid The trouble is that stupid hicks don t know what s good for them. They re getting conned by right wingers and tent revivalists until they believe all the lies that ve made them so wrong. They don t know any better. That s why they re voting against their own self interest. As anybody who has gone through a particularly nasty breakup knows, disdain cultivated in the aftermath of a divide quickly exceeds the original grievance. You lose somebody. You blame them. Soon, the blame is reason enough to keep them at a distance, the excuse to drive them even further away. Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful, hapless rubes, smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt. The result is a self fulfilling prophecy. Financial incentive compounded this tendency there is money, after all, in reassuring the bitter. Over years, an industry arose to cater to the smug style. It began in humor, and culminated for a time in The Daily Show, a program that more than any other thing advanced the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were, before anything else, stupid. The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing them. The internet only made it worse. Today, a liberal who finds himself troubled by the currents of contemporary political life need look no further than his Facebook newsfeed to find the explanation Study finds Daily Show viewers more informed than viewers of Fox News. They re beating CNN watchers too. NPR listeners are best informed of all. He likes that. You re better off watching nothing than watching Fox. He likes that even more. The good news doesn t stop. Liberals aren t just better informed. They re smarter. They ve got better grammar. They know more words. Smart kids grow up to be liberals, while conservatives reason like drunks. Liberals are better able to process new information they re less biased like that. They ve got different brains. Better ones. Why? Evolution. They ve got better brains, top notch amygdalae, science finds. The smug style created a feedback loop. If the trouble with conservatives was ignorance, then the liberal impulse was to correct it. When such corrections failed, disdain followed after it. Of course, there is a smug style in every political movement elitism among every ideology believing itself in possession of the solutions to society s ills. But few movements have let the smug tendency so corrupt them, or make so tenuous its case against its enemies. Conservatives are always at a bit of a disadvantage in the theater of mass democracy, the conservative editorialist Kevin Williamson wrote in National Review last October, because people en masse aren t very bright or sophisticated, and they re vulnerable to cheap, hysterical emotional appeals. The smug style thinks Williamson is wrong, of course, but not in principle. It s only that he s confused about who the hordes of stupid, hysterical people are voting for. The smug style reads Williamson and says, No! You! Elites, real elites, might recognize one another by their superior knowledge. The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowing. Knowing, for example, that the Founding Fathers were all secular deists. Knowing that you re actually, like, times more likely to shoot yourself than an intruder. Knowing that those fools out in Kansas are voting against their own self interest and that the trouble is Kansas doesn t know any better. Knowing all the jokes that signal this knowledge. The studies, about Daily Show viewers and better sized amygdalae, are knowing. It is the smug style s first premise a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture. A politics that is just the politics of smart people in command of Good Facts. A politics that insists it has no ideology at all, only facts. No moral convictions, only charts, the kind that keep them from imposing their morals like the bad guys do. Knowing is the shibboleth into the smug style s culture, a cultural that celebrates hip commitments and valorizes hip taste, that loves nothing more than hate reading anyone who doesn t get them. A culture that has come to replace politics itself. The knowing know that police reform, that abortion rights, that labor unions are important, but go no further What is important, after all, is to signal that you know these things. What is important is to launch links and mockery at those who don t. The Good Facts are enough Anybody who fails to capitulate to them is part of the Problem, is terminally uncool. No persuasion, only retweets. Eye roll, crying emoji, forward to John Oliver for sick burns. The smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn t always so totalizing. Lionel Trilling claimed, as far back as , that liberalism is not only the dominant, but even the sole intellectual tradition, that the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse ... do not express themselves in ideas, but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas. The smug style has always existed in American liberalism, but it wasn t always so totalizing Richard Hofstadter, the historian whose most famous work, The Paranoid Style in American Politics, this essay exists in some obvious reference to, advanced a similar line in writing not so well remembered today. His then influential history writing drips with disdain for rubes who regard themselves as victimized by economics and history, who have failed to maintain correct political attitudes. But years ago, American liberalism relied too much on the support of working people to let these ideas take too much hold. Even its elitists, its Schlesingers and Bells, were tempered by the power of the labor movement, by the role Marxism still played in even liberal politics forces too powerful to allow non elite concerns to entirely escape the liberal mental horizon. Walter Reuther, and Bayard Rustin, and A. Philip Randolph were still in the room, and they mattered. Sixty years ago, the ugliest tendencies were still private, too. The smug style belonged to real elites, knowing in their cocktail parties, far from the ears of rubes. But today we have television, and the internet, and a liberalism worked out in universities and think tanks. Today, the better part of liberalism is Trillings or those who d like to be, at any rate and everyone can hear them. On June , , the Supreme Court found that denying marriage licenses to same sex couples constituted a violation of the th Amendment. After decades of protests, legislation, setbacks, and litigation, the states still holding out against the inevitable were ordered to relent. Kim Davis, a clerk tasked with issuing marriage licenses to couples in her Kentucky county, refused. At the distance of six months, it is surprising that she was, beyond a few short lived and empty efforts, the only civil bureaucrat to do so. One imagines a hundred or a thousand Kim Davises in the country, small administrators with small power, outraged by the collapse of a moral fight that they were winning just a few years prior. In the days between the June decision and the July announcement that the American Civil Liberties Union would represent four couples who had been denied marriage licenses by the Rowan County Clerk s office, many braced for resistance. Surely compliance would come hard in some places. Surely, some of the losers would refuse to give up. There was something giddy about it at long last, the good guys would be the ones bearing down with the full force of the law. It did not take long for the law to correct Davis. On August , a judge ordered a stay, preventing Davis from refusing any further under the protection of the law. The Sixth Circuit, and then the Supreme Court, refused to hear her appeal. Despite further protest and Davis s ultimate jailing for contempt of court, normal service was restored in short order. The , people of Rowan Country suffered, all told, slightly less than seven weeks without a functioning civil licensure apparatus. Davis remained a fixation. Dour, rural, thrice divorced but born again Twitter could not have invented a better parody of the uncool. She was ridiculed for her politics but also for her looks that she had been married so many times was inexplicable! That she thought she had the slightest grasp of the Constitution, doubly so. When Davis was jailed for five days following her refusal to comply with the court order, many who pride themselves on having a vastly more compassionate moral foundation than Davis cheered the imprisonment of a political foe. The ridicule of Davis became so pronounced that even smug circles, always on the precipice of self reproach, began eventually to rein in the excess. Mocking her appearance, openly celebrating the incarceration of an ideological opponent these were not good looks. Kim Davis at a rally in September Ty Wright Getty Images But a more fundamental element of smug disdain for Kim Davis went unchallenged the contention, at bottom, that Davis was not merely wrong in her convictions, but that her convictions were, in themselves, an error and a fraud. That is Kim Davis was not only on the wrong side of the law. She was not even a subscriber to a religious ideology that had found itself at moral odds with American culture. Rather, she was a subscriber to nothing, a hateful bigot who did not even understand her own religion. Christianity, as many hastened to point out, is about love. Christ commands us to render unto Caesar what is Caesar s. If the Bible took any position on the issue at all, it was that divorce, beloved by Davis, was a sin, and that she was a hypocrite masquerading among the faithful. How many of these critiques were issued by atheists? This, more than anything I can recall in recent American life, is an example of the smug style. Many liberals do not believe that evangelical Christianity ought to guide public life many believe, moreover, that the moral conceits of that Christianity are wrong, even harmful to society. But to the smug liberal, it isn t that Kim Davis is wrong. How can she be? She s only mistaken. She just doesn t know the Good Facts, even about her own religion. She s angry and confused, another hick who s not with it. It was an odd thing to assert in the case of Christianity, a religion that until recently was taken to be another shibboleth of the uncool, not a loving faith misunderstood by bigots. But this is knowing knowing that the new line on Jesus is that the homophobes just don t get their own faith. Kim Davis was behind the times. Her beliefs did not represent a legitimate challenge to liberal consensus because they did not represent a challenge at all They were incoherent, at odds with the Good Facts. Google makes every man a theologian. This, I think, is fundamental to understanding the smug style. If good politics and good beliefs are just Good Facts and good tweets that is, if there is no ideology beyond sensible conclusions drawn from a rational assessment of the world then there are no moral fights, only lying liars and the stupid rubes who believe them. When Davis was first released from county jail, Mike Huckabee went to meet her. But the smug style sees no true ideology there, no moral threat to contend with. Only a huckster and a hick one to be ridiculed, and the other to be refuted. What more, the smug man posts, could there be to say about it? They re idiots! Look, look This Onion article nails it. Popular story Adlai Stevenson, Democratic candidate for president, is on parade. A band is playing. Onlookers cheer. He waves to the crowd. A woman shouts Gov. Stevenson, you have the vote of every thinking person in this country! Stevenson replies Thank you, ma am, but we need a majority. The smug style says to itself, Yeah. I really am one of the few thinking people in this country, aren t I? In November of last year, during the week when it became temporarily fashionable for American governors to declare that Syrian refugees would not be welcome in their state, Hamilton Nolan wrote an essay for Gawker called Dumb Hicks Are America s Greatest Threat. If there has ever been a tirade so dedicated to the smug style, to the proposition that it is neither malice, nor capital, nor ideological difference, but rather the backward stupidity of poor people that has ruined the state of American policy, then it is hidden beyond our view, in some uncool place, far from the front page of Gawker. Learn more Why have weddings and houses gotten so ridiculously expensive? Blame inequality. Many of America s political leaders are warning of the dangers posed by Syrian refugees. They are underestimating, though, the much greater danger dumbass hicks, in charge of things, Nolan wrote. ...You, our elected officials, are embarrassing us. All of us, except your fellow dumb hicks, who voted for you in large numbers. You our racist, xenophobic, knuckle dragging ignorant leaders are making us look bad in front of the guests the whole world . You are the bad cousin in the family who always ruins Thanksgiving. Go in the back room and drink a can of beer alone please. Among the dumb hicks Nolan identifies are many Southern mayors and many lesser known state representatives. He cites the Ku Klux Klan exclusively dumbass hicks, he writes. , he emphasizes despite the fact that the New York Times, in an investigation of white supremacist members of Stormfront.org, found that the top reported interest of Stormfront members is reading. That they are news and political junkies. Despite the fact that if you come compare Stormfront users to people who go to the Yahoo News site, it turns out that the Stormfront crowd is twice as likely to visit nytimes.com. They have long threads praising Breaking Bad and discussing the comparative merits of online dating sites, like Plenty of Fish and OKCupid, the Times reports. In another piece, published later the same month, Nolan wrote that Inequality of wealth or, if you like, the distribution of wealth in our society in a way that results in poverty is not just one issue among many. It is the root from which blooms nearly all major social problems. He s right about that. But who does he imagine is responsible for this inequality? The poor? The dumb? The hicks? Hamilton Nolan isn t stupid. He has even, lately, argued that even the worst of the rubes must be allies in class struggle. Yet the trouble is still swallowing what motherfuckers those people are. Nolan is perhaps the funniest and most articulate of those pointing fingers at the dumbass hicks, but he isn t alone. It is evidently intolerable to a huge swath of liberalism to confess the obvious that those responsible have homes in Brooklyn, too. That they buy the same smartphones. That they too are on Twitter. That the oligarchs are making fun of stupid poor people too. That they re better at it, and always will be. No The trouble must be out there, somewhere. In the country. Where the idiots are where the hicks are too stupid to know where problems blossom. To the dumb hick leaders of America, I say nothing . You wouldn t listen anyhow, Nolan writes. My words would go in one ear and right out the other. Like talking to an old block of wood. It s a shame. They might be receptive to his concerns about poverty. If there is a single person who exemplifies the dumbass hick in the smug imagination, it is former President George W. Bush. He s got the accent. He can t talk right. He seems stupefied by simple concepts, and his politics are all gee whiz Texas ignorance. He is the ur hick. He is the enemy. He got all the way to White House, and he s still being taken for a ride by the scheming rightwing oligarchs around him just like those poor rubes in Kansas. If only George knew Dick Cheney wasn t acting in his own best interests! It is worth considering that Bush is the son of a president, a patrician born in Connecticut and educated at Andover and Harvard and Yale. It is worth considering that he does not come from a family known for producing poor minds. It is worth considering that beginning with his gubernatorial debate against Ann Richards, and at every juncture thereafter, opponents have been defeated after days of media outlets openly speculating whether George was up to the mental challenge of a one on one debate. Throughout his short political career, ABC s Katy Textor wrote on the eve of the debates against Al Gore, Bush has benefited from low expectations of his debating abilities. The fact that he skipped no less than three GOP primary debates, and the fact that he was reluctant to agree to the Commission on Presidential Debates proposal, has done little to contradict the impression of a candidate uncomfortable with this unavoidable fact of campaign life. Done little to contradict. George W. Bush and Al Gore during a presidential debate in . Tannen Maury AFP Getty Images On November , , during his final pre election stump speech, Bush explained his history of political triumph thusly They misunderesimated me. What an idiot. American liberals made fun of him for that one for years. It is worth considering that he didn t misspeak. He did, however, deliberately cultivate the confusion. He understood the smug style. He wagered that many liberals, eager to see their opponents as intellectually deficient, would buy into the act and thereby miss the more pernicious fact of his moral deficits. He wagered correctly. Smug liberals said George was too stupid to get elected, too stupid to get reelected, too stupid to pass laws or appoint judges or weather a political fight. Liberals misunderestimated George W. Bush all eight years of his presidency. George W. Bush is not a dumbass hick. In eight years, all the sick Daily Show burns in the world did not appreciably undermine his agenda. The smug mind defends itself against these charges. Oh, we re just having fun, it says. We don t mean it. This is just for a laugh, it s just a joke, stop being so humorless. It is exasperating, after all, to have to live in a country where so many people are so aggressively wrong about so much, they say. You go on about ideology and shibboleths and knowing, but we are right on the issues, aren t we? We are right on social policy and right on foreign policy and right on evolution, and same sex marriage, and climate change too. Surely that s what matters. We don t really mean they re all stupid but hey, lay off. We re not smug! This is just how we vent our frustration. Otherwise it would be too depressing having to share a country with these people! We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief and not, for instance, the animating public strategy of an entire wing of the liberal culture apparatus. The Daily Show, as it happens, is not the private entertainment of elites blowing off some steam. It is broadcast on national television. Twitter isn t private. Not that anybody with the sickest burn to accompany the smartest chart would want it to be. Otherwise, how would everyone know how in the know you are? The rubes have seen your videos. You posted it on their wall. Still don t get why liberal opinion is correct? This video settles the debate for good. I have been wondering for a long time how it is that so many entries to the op ed pages take it as their justifying premise that they are arguing for a truth that has never been advanced before. We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief It s an accepted, nearly unchallenged assumption that Muslim communities across the U.S. have a problem that their youth tend toward violent ideology, or are susceptible to radicalization by groups like the Islamic State, began an editorial that appeared last December in the New York Times. But after all, it goes on, the majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white men but no one questions what might have radicalized them in their communities. But this contention that Muslims possess superlative violent tendencies has been challenged countless times, hasn t it? It was challenged here, and here and here as far back as . The president of the United State challenged it on national television the night before this editorial was published. The Times itself did too. The myopic provincialism of anybody who believes that Muslims are a uniquely violent people is the basis of a five year old Onion headline, not some new moral challenge. The smug style leaves its adherents no other option If an idea has failed to take hold, if the Good Facts are not widely accepted, then the problem must be that these facts have not yet reached the disbelievers. In December , Public Policy Polling found that percent of Republicans were in favor of bombing Agrabah, the Arab sounding fictional city from Disney s Aladdin. Hilarious. PPP has run joke questions before, of course polling the popularity of Deez Nuts, or asking after God s job approval. But these questions, at least, let their audience in on the gag. Now liberalism is deliberately setting up the last segment of the population actually willing to endure a phone survey in service of what it knew would make for some hilarious copy when the rubes inevitably fell for it. This is not a survey in service of a joke it is a survey in service of a human punchline. As if only Republicans covered up gaps in their knowledge by responding to what they assume is a good faith question by guessing from their general principles. It may be easy to mistake with the private venting of frustrated elites, but the rubes can read the New York Times, too. It is not where liberals whisper to each other about the secret things that go unchallenged. Poll respondents are not the secret fodder for a joke. Learn more Late breaking sexism why younger women aren t excited about electing a woman president This is the consequence of private venting, and it is the consequence of knowing too If good politics comes solely from good data and good sense, it cannot be that large sections of the American public are merely wrong about so many vital things. It cannot be that they have heard our arguments but rejected them that might mean we must examine our own methods of persuasion. No it is only that the wrong beliefs are unchallenged that their believers are trapped in information bubbles and confirmation bias. That no one knows the truth, except the New York Times or Vox . If only we could tell them, question them, show them this graph. If they don t get it then, well, then they re hopeless. The smug style plays out in private too, of course. If you haven t started one yourself, you ve surely seen the Facebook threads Ten or of Brooklyn s finest gather to say how exasperated they are, these days, by the stupidity of the American public. I just don t know what to do about these people, one posts. I think we have to accept that a lot of people are just misinformed! replies another. Like, I think they actually don t want to know anything that would undermine their worldview. They tend to do it in the comment section, under an article about how conservatives are difficult to persuade because they isolate themselves in mutually reinforcing information bubbles. What have been the consequences of the smug style? It has become a tradition for the smug, in editorials and essay and confident Facebook boasting, to assume that the presidential debates will feature their candidate, in command of the facts, wiping the floor with the empty huckster ignorance of their Republican opponent. It was popularly assumed, for a time, that George W. Bush was too stupid to be elected president. The smug believed the same of Ronald Reagan. John Yoo, the architect of the Bush administration s torture policies, escaped The Daily Show unscathed. Liberals wondered what to do when Jon Stewart fails. What would success look like? Were police waiting in the wings, a one way ticket to the Hague if Stewart nailed him? It would be unfair to say that the smug style has never learned from these mistakes. But the lesson has been, We underestimated how many people could be fooled. That is We underestimated just how dumb these dumb hicks really are. We just didn t get our message to them. They just stayed in their information bubble. We can t let the lying liars keep lying to these people but how do we reach these idiots who only trust Fox? Rarely Maybe they re savvier than we thought. Maybe they re angry for a reason. As it happens, reasons aren t too difficult to come by. During a San Francisco fundraiser in the primary campaign, Barack Obama offered an observation that was hailed not without some glee as the first unforced error from then Senator Cool. You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania, Obama said, and, like, a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for years and nothing s replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton administration, and the Bush administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate, and they have not. And it s not surprising then they get bitter. They cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren t like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations. It s the latter part that we remember eight years later the clinging to guns and religion and hate but it is the first part that was important the part about lost jobs and neglect by two presidential administrations. Obama s observation was not novel. The notion that material loss and abandonment have driven America s white working class into a fit of resentment is boilerplate for even the Democratic Party s tepid left these days. But in the president s formulation and in the formulation of smug stylists who have embraced some material account of uncool attitudes, the downturn, the jobs lost and the opportunities narrowed, are a force of nature something that has been happening in the passive voice. If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it s, Why are they voting against their own self interest? This, I suspect, will one day become the Republican Party s rationale for addressing climate change Look, we don t know how the dead hooker wound up in the hotel room. But she s here now, that s undeniable, so we ve gotta get rid of the body. Today, it is the excuse of American smug mind Where did all of these poor people come from? If pressed for an answer, I suppose they would say Republicans, elected by rubes voting against their own self interest. Reagan, Gingrich, Bush all those Bad Fact knowing halfwits who were too dumb to get elected to anything. Well, sure. In the past years of American life, the Republican Party has dedicated itself to replacing every labor law with a photo of Ronald Reagan s face. But this does not excuse liberals beating full retreat to the colleges and the cities, abandoning the dispossessed to their fate. It does not excuse surrendering a century of labor politics in the name of electability. It does not excuse gazing out decades later to find that those left behind are not up on the latest thought and deciding, We didn t abandon them. The idiots didn t want to be saved. It was not Ronald Reagan who declared the era of big government. It was not the GOP that decided the coastally based, culturally liberal industries of technology, Hollywood, and high finance were the future of the American economy. If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence, it s, Why are they voting against their own self interest? But no party these past decades has effectively represented the interests of these dispossessed. Only one has made a point of openly disdaining them too. Abandoned and without any party willing to champion their interests, people cling to candidates who, at the very least, are willing to represent their moral convictions. The smug style resents them for it, and they resent the smug in turn. The rubes noticed that liberal Democrats, distressed by the notion that Indiana would allow bakeries to practice open discrimination against LGBTQ couples, threatened boycotts against the state, mobilizing the considerable economic power that comes with an alliance of New York and Hollywood and Silicon Valley to punish retrograde Gov. Mike Pence, but had no such passion when the same governor of the same state joined others in refusing the Medicaid expansion. No doubt good liberals objected to that move too. But I ve yet to see a boycott threat about it. Early in the marriage equality fight, activists advanced the theory that when people discovered a friend or relative was gay, they became far more likely to support gay rights. They were correct. These days it is difficult for anybody in a position of liberal power whether in business, or government, or media to avoid having openly gay colleagues, colleagues whom they like and whom they d like to help. But few opinion makers fraternize with the impoverished. Few editors and legislators and Silicon Valley heroes have dinner with the lovely couple on food stamps down the road, much less those scraping by in Indiana. If any single event provided the direct impetus for this essay, it was a running argument I had with an older, liberal writer over the seriousness of Donald Trump s presidential campaign. Since June , when Trump announced his candidacy, this writer has taken it upon himself each day to tell his Facebook followers that Donald Trump is a bad kind of dude. That saying as much was the key to stopping him and his odious followers too. Ridicule is the most powerful weapon we have against any of our enemies, he told me in the end, but especially against the ones who, not incorrectly, take it so personally and lash out in ways that shine klieg lights on those very flaws we detest. If you re laughing at someone, you re certainly not respecting him. Anyway, he went on, I m done talking to you. We see the world differently. I m fine with that. We don t need to be friends. Ridicule is the most effective political tactic. Ridicule is especially effective when it s personal and about expressing open disdain for stupid, bad people. Political legitimacy is granted by the respect of elite liberals. You can t be legitimate if you re the butt of our jokes. If you don t agree, we can t work together politically. We can t even be friends, because politics is social. Because politics is performative if we don t mock together, we aren t on the same side. If there is a bingo card for the smug style somewhere, then cross off every square. You ve won. I would be less troubled if I did not believe that the smug style has captured an enormous section of American liberalism. If I believed that its politics, as practiced by its supporters, extended beyond this line of thought. If this were an exception. But even as many have come around to the notion that Trump is the prohibitive favorite for his party s nomination, the smug interpretation has been predictable We only underestimated how hateful, how stupid, the Republican base can be. A Donald Trump rally in Pittsburgh. Jeff Swensen Getty Images Trump capturing the nomination will not dispel the smug style if anything, it will redouble it. Faced with the prospect of an election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the smug will reach a fever pitch six straight months of a sure thing, an opportunity to mock and scoff and ask, How could anybody vote for this guy? until a morning in November when they ask, What the fuck happened? On March , Salon s David Masciotra wrote that if Trump actually had the strength to articulate uncomfortable and inconvenient truths, he would turn his favorite word loser ??not on full time professionals in the press, but on his supporters. Masciotra goes on Journalists found that in the counties where Trump is most dominant, there are large numbers of white high school dropouts, and unemployed people no longer looking for work. An alliance with the incoherent personality cult of Donald Trump s candidacy correlates strongly with failure to obtain a high school diploma, and withdrawal from the labor force. The counties also have a consistent history of voting for segregationists, and have an above average percentage of its residents living in mobile homes. The kicker Many conservatives, and even some kindhearted liberals, might object to the conclusions one can draw from the data as stereotyping, but the empirical evidence leaves little choice. Donald Trump s supporters confirm the stereotype against them. Here s the conclusion I draw If Donald Trump has a chance in November, it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy. Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse, they will comfort with own impotence by shouting, Idiots! again and again, angrier and angrier, the handmaidens of their own destruction. The smug style resists empathy for the unknowing. It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture, who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with, in spite of these differences, toward a common goal. It is this attitude that has driven the dispossessed into the arms of a candidate who shares their fury. It is this attitude that may deliver him the White House, a serious threat, a threat to be mocked and called out and hated, but not to be taken seriously. The wages of smug is Trump. Nothing is more confounding to the smug style than the fact that the average Republican is better educated and has a higher IQ than the average Democrat. That for every overpowered study finding superior liberal open mindedness and intellect and knowledge, there is one to suggest that Republicans have the better of these qualities. Most damning, perhaps, to the fancy liberal self conception Republicans score higher in susceptibility to persuasion. They are willing to change their minds more often. The Republican coalition tends toward the center educated enough, smart enough, informed enough. The Democratic coalition in the st century is bifurcated It has the postgraduates, but it has the disenfranchised urban poor as well, a group better defined by race and immigration status than by class. There are more Americans without high school diplomas than in possession of doctoral degrees. The math proceeds from there. The smug style takes this as a defense. Elite liberalism, and the Democratic Party by extension, cannot hate poor people, they say. We aren t smug! Just look at our coalition. These aren t rubes. Just look at our embrace of their issues. But observe how quickly professed concern for the oppressed becomes another shibboleth for the smug, another kind of knowing. Mere awareness of these issues becomes the most important thing, the capacity to articulate them a new subset of Correct Facts. Everyone in the know has read The Case for Reparations, but it was the reading and performed admiration that counted, praised in the same breath as, It is a better history than an actual case for actually paying, of course... Pretend for a moment that all of it is true. That the smug style apprehended the world as it really is, that knowing or knowing, no inflection did make our political divide. That the problem is the rubes. That the dumbass hicks are to blame. They can t help it Their brains don t work. They isolate themselves from all the Good Facts, and they re being taken for a ride by con men. Pretend the ridicule worked too that the videos and the Twitter burns and destroying the opposition made all the bad guys go away. What kind of world would it leave us? An endless cycle of jokes? Of sick burns and smart tweets and knowing? Relative to whom? The smug style demands an object of disdain it would find a new one quickly. It is central to the liberal self conception that what separates them from reactionaries is a desire to help people, a desire to create a fairer and more just world. Liberals still want, or believe they still want, to make a more perfect union. Whether you believe they are deluded or not, whether you believe this project is worthwhile in any form or not, what I am trying to tell you is that the smug style has fundamentally undermined even the aspiration, that it has made American liberalism into the worst version of itself. It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them. It becomes all at once too easy to decide you know best, to never hear, much less ignore, protest to the contrary. At present, many of those most in need of the sort of help liberals believe they can provide despise liberalism, and are despised in turn. Is it surprising that with each decade, the help on offer drifts even further from the help these people need? It is impossible, in the long run, to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them Even if the two could be separated, would it be worth it? What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating for? The smug style, at bottom, is a failure of empathy. Further It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all. It is the notion that anybody worthy of liberal time and attention and respect must capitulate, immediately, to the Good Facts. If they don t and they won t you re free to write them off and mock them. When they suffer, it s their just desserts. Make no mistake I am not suggesting that liberals adopt a fuzzy, gentler version of their politics. I am not suggesting they compromise their issues for the sake of playing nice. What I am suggesting is that the battles waged by liberalism have drifted far away from their old egalitarian intentions. I am suggesting that open disdain for the people they say they want to help has led them to stop helping those people, too. I am suggesting that in the case of a Kim Davis, liberalism resist the impulse to go beyond the necessary legal fight and explicitly delight in punishing an old foe. I am suggesting that they instead wonder what it might be like to have little left but one s values to wake up one day to find your whole moral order destroyed to look around and see the representatives of a new order call you a stupid, hypocritical hick without bothering, even, to wonder how your corner of your poor state found itself so alienated from them in the first place. To work with people who do not share their values or their tastes, who do not live where they live or like what they like or know their Good Facts or their jokes. This is not a call for civility. Manners are not enough. The smug style did not arise by accident, and it cannot be abolished with a little self reproach. So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class, they will search for reasons to justify that failure. They will resent them. They will find, over and over, how easy it is to justify abandoning them further. They will choose the smug style. Maybe the cycle is too deeply set already. Perhaps the divide, the disdain, the whole crack up are inevitable. But if liberal good intentions are to make a play for a better future, they cannot merely recognize the ways they ve come to hate their former allies. They must begin to mend the ways they lost them in the first place.",

        "text": "The Republican Party s attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic. If only he would mouth the party s conservative principles, all would be well. But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology. It has nothing to do with the Republican Party, either, except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy. Trump has transcended the party that produced him. His growing army of supporters no longer cares about the party. Because it did not immediately and fully embrace Trump, because a dwindling number of its political and intellectual leaders still resist him, the party is regarded with suspicion and even hostility by his followers. Their allegiance is to him and him alone. And the source of allegiance? We re supposed to believe that Trump s support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation. Maybe some of it does. But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies his proposals change daily. What he offers is an attitude, an aura of crude strength and machismo, a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims, and his followers believe, has produced national weakness and incompetence. His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain, intermingled with bits of fear, hatred and anger. His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of others Muslims, Hispanics, women, Chinese, Mexicans, Europeans, Arabs, immigrants, refugees whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision. His program, such as it is, consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion. He will deport them, bar them, get them to knuckle under, make them pay up or make them shut up. That this tough guy, get mad and get even approach has gained him an increasingly large and enthusiastic following has probably surprised Trump as much as anyone else. Trump himself is simply and quite literally an egomaniac. But the phenomenon he has created and now leads has become something larger than him, and something far more dangerous. Republican politicians marvel at how he has tapped into a hitherto unknown swath of the voting public. But what he has tapped into is what the founders most feared when they established the democratic republic the popular passions unleashed, the mobocracy. Conservatives have been warning for decades about government suffocating liberty. But here is the other threat to liberty that Alexis de Tocqueville and the ancient philosophers warned about that the people in a democracy, excited, angry and unconstrained, might run roughshod over even the institutions created to preserve their freedoms. As Alexander Hamilton watched the French Revolution unfold, he feared in America what he saw play out in France that the unleashing of popular passions would lead not to greater democracy but to the arrival of a tyrant, riding to power on the shoulders of the people. This phenomenon has arisen in other democratic and quasi democratic countries over the past century, and it has generally been called fascism. Fascist movements, too, had no coherent ideology, no clear set of prescriptions for what ailed society. National socialism was a bundle of contradictions, united chiefly by what, and who, it opposed fascism in Italy was anti liberal, anti democratic, anti Marxist, anti capitalist and anti clerical. Successful fascism was not about policies but about the strongman, the leader Il Duce, Der F hrer , in whom could be entrusted the fate of the nation. Whatever the problem, he could fix it. Whatever the threat, internal or external, he could vanquish it, and it was unnecessary for him to explain how. Today, there is Putinism, which also has nothing to do with belief or policy but is about the tough man who single handedly defends his people against all threats, foreign and domestic. To understand how such movements take over a democracy, one only has to watch the Republican Party today. These movements play on all the fears, vanities, ambitions and insecurities that make up the human psyche. In democracies, at least for politicians, the only thing that matters is what the voters say they want vox populi vox Dei. A mass political movement is thus a powerful and, to those who would oppose it, frightening weapon. When controlled and directed by a single leader, it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses. If someone criticizes or opposes the leader, it doesn t matter how popular or admired that person has been. He might be a famous war hero, but if the leader derides and ridicules his heroism, the followers laugh and jeer. He might be the highest ranking elected guardian of the party s most cherished principles. But if he hesitates to support the leader, he faces political death. In such an environment, every political figure confronts a stark choice Get right with the leader and his mass following or get run over. The human race in such circumstances breaks down into predictable categories and democratic politicians are the most predictable. There are those whose ambition leads them to jump on the bandwagon. They praise the leader s incoherent speeches as the beginning of wisdom, hoping he will reward them with a plum post in the new order. There are those who merely hope to survive. Their consciences won t let them curry favor so shamelessly, so they mumble their pledges of support, like the victims in Stalin s show trials, perhaps not realizing that the leader and his followers will get them in the end anyway. RNC chairman Republicans will find common ground with Trump Play Video Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the GOP will find common ground ahead of the general election. Reuters A great number will simply kid themselves, refusing to admit that something very different from the usual politics is afoot. Let the storm pass, they insist, and then we can pick up the pieces, rebuild and get back to normal. Meanwhile, don t alienate the leader s mass following. After all, they are voters and will need to be brought back into the fold. As for Trump himself, let s shape him, advise him, steer him in the right direction and, not incidentally, save our political skins. What these people do not or will not see is that, once in power, Trump will owe them and their party nothing. He will have ridden to power despite the party, catapulted into the White House by a mass following devoted only to him. By then that following will have grown dramatically. Today, less than percent of eligible voters have voted for Trump. But if he wins the election, his legions will likely comprise a majority of the nation. Imagine the power he would wield then. In addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following, he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command the Justice Department, the FBI, the intelligence services, the military. Who would dare to oppose him then? Certainly not a Republican Party that lay down before him even when he was comparatively weak. And is a man like Trump, with infinitely greater power in his hands, likely to become more humble, more judicious, more generous, less vengeful than he is today, than he has been his whole life? Does vast power un corrupt? This is how fascism comes to America, not with jackboots and salutes although there have been salutes, and a whiff of violence but with a television huckster, a phony billionaire, a textbook egomaniac tapping into popular resentments and insecurities, and with an entire national political party out of ambition or blind party loyalty, or simply out of fear falling into line behind him.",

        "text": "It s impossible to miss the Hillary for Prison signs at Trump rallies. At one of the Democratic debates, the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server. Oh for goodness that is not going to happen, she said. I m not even going to answer that question. Based on what I know about the emails, the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical. Nonetheless, the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive. A recent New York Times CBS poll found that of Democrats say she cannot be trusted. For decades she s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots, branded as a congenital liar and accused of covering up her husband s misconduct, from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky. Some of this is sexist caricature. Some is stoked by the Hillary is a liar videos that flood Facebook feeds. Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or zone of privacy that she protects too fiercely. It s a natural impulse, given the level of scrutiny she s attracted, more than any male politician I can think of. I would be dead rich , to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase, if I could bill for all the hours I ve spent covering just about every scandal that has enveloped the Clintons. As an editor I ve launched investigations into her business dealings, her fundraising, her foundation and her marriage. As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater. I m not a favorite in Hillaryland. That makes what I want to say next surprising. Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy. The yardsticks I use for measuring a politician s honesty are pretty simple. Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics, I ve looked for connections between money including campaign donations, loans, Super Pac funds, speaking fees, foundation ties and official actions. I m on the lookout for lies, scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election. The connection between money and action is often fuzzy. Many investigative articles about Clinton end up raising serious questions about potential conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment. Of course, she should be held accountable. It was bad judgment, as she has said, to use a private email server. It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees, but not corrupt. There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor. As for her statements on issues, Politifact, a Pulitzer prize winning fact checking organization, gives Clinton the best truth telling record of any of the presidential candidates. She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump, who has the biggest pants on fire rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president. He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as . I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold. As first lady, she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy. Instead, by not disclosing information, she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing. In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House, All Too Human, ABC s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret. The same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches. So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else. The speeches are probably anodyne politicians always praise their hosts , so why not release them? Colin Diersing, a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard s Institute of Politics, thinks a gender related double standard gets applied to Clinton. We expect purity from women candidates, he said. When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions, it s seen as dishonest , he adds. CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing s point when he asked Clinton Have you always told the truth? She gave an honest response, I ve always tried to, always. Always. Pelley said she was leaving wiggle room . What politician wouldn t? Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered. In her view, journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes. I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in . Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke. She glared down at us, launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons private life. The distrust continues. These are not new thoughts, but they are fundamental to understanding her. Tough as she can seem, she doesn t have rhino hide, and during her husband s first term in the White House, according to Her Way, a critical and excellent investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio. A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly. Like most politicians, she s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth. In debates with Sanders, she cites her tough record on Wall Street, but her Senate bills, like one curbing executive pay, went nowhere. She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income. But, according to an article by Gerth, she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in that would have closed it. She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed, drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren. Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage. Her earlier opposition to gay marriage, which she later endorsed, has hurt her with young people. Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals. Still, Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest. It s fair to expect more transparency. But it s a double standard to insist on her purity.",

        "text": "The presidential candidates have wildly varying tax proposals. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz propose massive cuts that would greatly reduce federal income taxes on everyone, especially the wealthy, while cutting a wide host of government programs. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders proposes virtually the opposite tax increases on everyone, with hikes on the wealthy especially, while adding comprehensive government programs. And Hillary Clinton proposes much smaller tax increases, all focused on the rich. But what do their plans mean for your federal tax liability? We partnered with the Tax Policy Center to create a calculator that will estimate how each presidential candidate s tax plan would affect you or, more accurately, people like you. For example, if you are part of a couple with two children earning , a year, this calculator tells you the average change in federal taxes for all couples with two children who earn between , and , a year. Before you change your vacation plans based on these numbers, keep in mind they are only estimates. Every taxpayer has a slightly different situation someone might be deducting business expenses, for example, while another person will be paying a tax for not carrying insurance coverage. This creates millions of different scenarios. Accounting for all of that is prohibitively complicated and time consuming. But what we have done is simplify the process to consider only the biggest factors income, marital status, and children and only look at the four taxes with the largest impact individual and corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and excise taxes . Try it yourself below. Note The Tax Policy Center did not perform an analysis of John Kasich s tax plan because his plan lacks sufficient detail to model. They have reached out to the Kasich campaign in search of more details, and will analyze the plan if they receive enough information to do so. The calculator How much does each candidate s tax plan affect you? Read this Ezra wrote a piece about what the tax calculator tells us about the candidates. On Cruz and Trump, he writes In a sense, both GOP candidates are gaming the calculator They ve proposed tremendous cuts, but without knowing who will pay for those cuts, it s hard to know who will truly be helped and who will be badly hurt. On Sanders, he writes Sanders, meanwhile, proposes to raise taxes by more than Trump proposes to cut them. But it s wrong, I think, to view Sanders s plan as primarily a change to America s tax code. The huge tax increases are a byproduct of Sanders s plans to nationalize major sectors of American life. Read the full analysis here. Update on why rates are higher than you think We ve been getting a lot of questions about why your current effective tax rate is so high. Here s a note from Tax Policy Center director Len Burman that explains why this is happening You might be surprised at how much taxes you re paying under current law. We re including payroll taxes, excise taxes, and corporate income taxes as well as individual income taxes. Most working people actually pay more in payroll tax than income tax. And they pay much more if you include the employer s portion of the tax. Most economists think employers pass their share of the tax on to workers in the form of lower wages. Update, plus a FAQ section To calculate the tax rate, we originally used adjusted gross income AGI , but we decided to switch over to expanded cash income ECI , because this measure includes income that is not subject to income tax, like health insurance premiums paid by employers. This allows the calculator to provide a more accurate view of your tax rate. For a longer explanation, read this Q A. What we learned from our calculator Play around with different incomes other than your own to get a better idea of how each candidate deals with the poor, middle class, and wealthy. In short, what you ll see is Clinton proposes keeping things mostly the same. Sanders wants to implement massive increases across the board, including on the poor. Cruz and Trump propose big cuts for everyone but the wealthier you are, the more you keep in your pocket. But how does this affect how much money the federal government brings in? It s one thing to know how your taxes will change, but you can t view it in a vacuum. What the federal government does can affect your bottom line, too. For example, Bernie Sanders s plan would raise taxes on everyone, but it would also pay for health care, education, and other programs that you would no longer have to pay for. And it goes the other way, too. If Donald Trump s tax plan was implemented, everyone would get a tax cut, but it also means government services would be cut, so you would have to pay for them yourself. So this is how each candidate deals with this balance Donald Trump His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated . trillion over the next decade. Cuts would be across the board, but most cuts would be for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. Here are more details on Trump s plan. Ted Cruz His plan would cut federal revenues by an estimated . trillion over the next decade. Much like Trump s plan, cuts would be across the board, but most cuts are for wealthier households. His tax cuts promise to stimulate economic growth and reduce government spending, which could cause households to pay more for services that are currently subsidized by the government. Here are more details on Cruz s plan. Hillary Clinton Her plan would raise federal revenues by an additional . trillion over the next decade. Most increases would be for wealthier households, while lower income households aren t affected much. The additional revenues will pay for programs that benefit many Americans. Here are more details on Clinton s plan. Bernie Sanders His plan would raise federal revenues by an estimated . trillion over the next decade. He would raise taxes for almost all households, but most increases would be for wealthier households tax increases would be small for lower and middle income households. Additional revenues would pay for health care, education, and other programs, so households would pay less than what they currently pay for those services. Here are more details on Sanders s plan. ",

        "text": "In the heat of a presidential campaign, you d think that a story about one party s nominee giving a large contribution to a state attorney general who promptly shut down an inquiry into that nominee s scam university would be enormous news. But we continue to hear almost nothing about what happened between Donald Trump and Florida attorney general Pam Bondi. I raised this issue last week, but it s worth an update as well as some contextualization. The story re emerged last week when The Post s David A. Fahrenthold reported that Trump paid a penalty to the IRS after his foundation made an illegal contribution to Bondi s PAC. While the Trump organization characterizes that as a bureaucratic oversight, the basic facts are that Bondi s office had received multiple complaints from Floridians who said they were cheated by Trump University while they were looking into it and considering whether to join a lawsuit over Trump University filed by the attorney general of New York State, Bondi called Trump and asked him for a , donation shortly after getting the check, Bondi s office dropped the inquiry. At this point we should note that everything here may be completely innocent. Perhaps Bondi didn t realize her office was looking into Trump University. Perhaps the fact that Trump s foundation made the contribution which, to repeat, is illegal was just a mix up. Perhaps when Trump reimbursed the foundation from his personal account, he didn t realize that s not how the law works the foundation would have to get its money back from Bondi s PAC he could then make a personal donation if he wanted . Perhaps Bondi s decision not to pursue the case against Trump was perfectly reasonable. But here s the thing We don t know the answers to those questions, because almost nobody seems to be pursuing them. For instance, there was only one mention of this story on any of the five Sunday shows, when John Dickerson asked Chris Christie about it on Face the Nation Christie took great umbrage I can t believe, John, that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that way . And the comparison with stories about Hillary Clinton s emails or the Clinton Foundation is extremely instructive. Whenever we get some new development in any of those Clinton stories, you see blanket coverage every cable network, every network news program, every newspaper investigates it at length. And even when the new information serves to exonerate Clinton rather than implicate her in wrongdoing, the coverage still emphasizes that the whole thing just raises questions about her integrity. The big difference is that there are an enormous number of reporters who get assigned to write stories about those issues regarding Clinton. The story of something like the Clinton Foundation gets stretched out over months and months with repeated tellings, always with the insistence that questions are being raised and the implication that shady things are going on, even if there isn t any evidence at a particular moment to support that idea. When it comes to Trump, on the other hand, we ve seen a very different pattern. Here s what happens A story about some kind of corrupt dealing emerges, usually from the dogged efforts of one or a few journalists it gets discussed for a couple of days and then it disappears. Someone might mention it now and again, but the news organizations don t assign a squad of reporters to look into every aspect of it, so no new facts are brought to light and no new stories get written. The end result of this process is that because of all that repeated examination of Clinton s affairs, people become convinced that she must be corrupt to the core. It s not that there isn t plenty of negative coverage of Trump, because of course there is, but it s focused mostly on the crazy things he says on any given day. But the truth is that you d have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption, double dealing, and fraud that Donald Trump has. The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering. Here s a partial list Trump s casino bankruptcies, which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their money Trump s habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him, many of whom are struggling small businesses Trump University, which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation, but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed. The Trump Institute, another get rich quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money The Trump Network, a multi level marketing venture a.k.a. pyramid scheme that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins Trump Model Management, which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U.S. illegally, and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did Trump s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts, which involves a claim that he can t find Americans to do the work Trump s use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the s, who were paid a pittance for their illegal work Trump s history of being charged with housing discrimination Trump s connections to mafia figures involved in New York construction The time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission , over charges that he violated anti trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino company The fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes, who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment. According to the allegations, Ailes s behavior was positively monstrous as just one indicator, his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well known and so loathsome that in the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected. And that last one is happening right now. To repeat, the point is not that these stories have never been covered, because they have. The point is that they get covered briefly, then everyone in the media moves on. If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton, news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them, those reporters would start asking questions, and we d learn more about all of them. That s important, because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in Trump is supposedly the crazy bigoted one, and Clinton is supposedly the corrupt one. Once we decide that those are the appropriate lenses through which the two candidates are to be viewed, it shapes the decisions the media make every day about which stories are important to pursue. And it means that to a great extent, for all the controversy he has caused and all the unflattering stories in the press about him, Trump is still being let off the hook.",

        "text": "Median income would soar by more than , . Nearly million jobs would be created. The unemployment rate would fall to . . Those are just a few of the things that would happen if Bernie Sanders became president and his ambitious economic program were put into effect, according to an analysis given exclusively to CNNMoney. The first comprehensive look at the impact of all of Sanders spending and tax proposals on the economy was done by Gerald Friedman, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor. This more sweeping analysis was not commissioned by the candidate, though Sanders policy director called it outstanding work. Friedman has worked with Sanders in the past, but has never received any compensation. The Vermont senator asked Friedman to estimate the cost of Sanders Medicare for all plan which came out to . trillion over years and included the analysis when he unveiled his proposal last month. Friedman, who believes in democratic socialism like the candidate, found that if Sanders became president and was able to push his plan through Congress median household income would be , by , far higher than the , projected by the Congressional Budget Office. In addition, poverty would plummet to a record low , as opposed to the CBO s forecast of . . The U.S. economy would grow by . per year, instead of . , and the nation s . trillion deficit would turn into a large surplus by Sanders second term. Other economists, however, feel that Friedman s analysis is overly optimistic, saying it would be difficult to achieve that level of economic prosperity. Last week, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said Sanders plan to pay for health care would fall short by at least trillion. Related unanswered questions about Bernie Sanders health care plan Sanders plan to pour . trillion into the economy including spending on infrastructure and youth employment, increasing Social Security benefits, making college free and expanding health care and family leave would juice GDP and productivity. Friedman reduces the cost of Medicare for all to . trillion because he estimates the government would save . trillion by eliminating tax breaks for health insurance premiums. Also, Sanders would raise the minimum wage, as well as shift income from the rich to the middle and working class through tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations. Like the New Deal of the s, Senator Sanders program is designed to do more than merely increase economic activity, Friedman writes. It will promote a more just prosperity, broadly based with a narrowing of economy inequality. Many presidential hopefuls say their economic programs would boost growth. Donald Trump and Jeb Bush justify their big tax cuts by saying GDP would grow at a rate. But their plans have been panned by experts as overly optimistic. Friedman, however, argues that Sanders plan would be more stimulative because it is pouring money into the economy, as opposed to cutting taxes. Several of Sanders proposals such as spending trillion on infrastructure will happen in the first few years of his administration. The thinking goes This enhanced government spending would increase demand on businesses, who would then hire more workers to meet their needs. The increase in employment will prompt people to buy more, leading other businesses to hire. If there is more spending, people will have more to do, Friedman said, noting that the share of the population with jobs could be restored to its level of more than , up from its current . rate. Related Can Bernie Sanders deliver free college for all? Not so easily Sanders policy director, Warren Gunnels, also defended the estimates, noting the candidate is thinking big. We haven t had such an ambitious agenda to rebuild the middle class since Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Johnson, he said. Sword swallowers and acrobats turn out for Bernie in Brooklyn Sword swallowers and acrobats turn out for Bernie in Brooklyn Still, some experts question whether the effects would be that large. Stimulating demand can boost a weak economy during a recession, but it s harder to accept as a long run growth strategy, said William Gale, the former director of Brookings Economic Studies Program. Also, it would be very difficult to achieve and maintain an economic growth rate of . per year after inflation. That target hasn t been hit consistently since the s, when technology was providing big advancements, the workforce was younger and there was increased demand for American products worldwide as other countries fully recovered from World War II. The . number is a fantasy, said Jim Kessler, senior vice president at Third Way, a centrist think tank.",

        "text": "I don t know about you, but I m getting tired of presidential election media coverage. It s been a mess since the beginning, when Donald Trump kicked off his campaign with the statement that Mexicans are rapists, and major news channels and newspapers responded by giving him just what he wanted more coverage than any other candidate. For months I maintained the position that if we all stopped clicking on Donald Trump headlines, he would go away. But no one was interested in that strategy, and now it s too late to implement it. The media played a major role in Donald Trump s rise to power, and now it seems as though they are rooting for him to maintain it. Two weeks ago, a woman filed a federal lawsuit against Donald Trump, alleging that he raped her in , when she was years old. Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is Jeffrey Epstein, a man who has already served a year in prison for soliciting an underage prostitute, and who was recently described by Donald Trump as a terrific guy. This story was first reported on June th by The Real Deal, a publication dedicated to covering New York real estate news. It was picked up by Gothamist, The Daily Beast, Snopes, and a few other websites. I did not learn about the case until a friend of mine shared this Huffington Post blog about it. The case was not covered in Huffington Post s news section, nor in the news section of any major publication. Meanwhile, I received two New York Times push notifications this week with updates about Hillary Clinton s emails. Has the media decided Donald Trump is just so despicable that it isn t worth covering another atrocity allegedly perpetrated by him, while Hillary Clinton is expected to be a perfect human being, so more coverage of her emails serves the public good? Have they decided Donald Trump is just so immune to negative coverage that reporting this lawsuit is a waste of time, while another story on Hillary s email server is guaranteed to make her even more unpopular? Or, is giving credence to rape accusations against powerful men still socially unacceptable? Re Peyton Manning It s difficult for me not to think that sexism has a hand in guiding the media s wacky priority list. I know a lot of people are getting tired of accusations of sexism in this presidential race, but sexism would explain why a female candidate sending emails from a private server faces a thousand times more public scrutiny than a male candidate allegedly raping a child. To reiterate what has already been determined about Hillary s emails Federal law did not prohibit public officials from using private email accounts until , after she left office, and none of her emails were considered classified at the time she sent them via a private server. And yet, Hillary is branded a criminal, while Donald Trump who has now had three legal claims of sexual assault filed against him remains the successful businessman whose greatest offense is his ego. You can counter that the claims of sexual assault against Donald Trump are unproven in a court of law, and to that I will counter that Hillary has not been convicted of any crimes either. In this country, the principle of innocent until proven guilty tends to serve the privileged. That principle goes out the window when we discuss accusations against women and people of color. Donald Trump may be a megalomaniac who has no experience in public office and has shocked the entire world by making it this far in the race, but the absurdity of his candidacy does not mean that he should be vetted less critically than his opponent. He may be a racist and a misogynist from whom we can never expect anything but the worst, but the reality is that he s one election away from being the most powerful person on the planet. If we dismiss his transgressions as just being typical of his character, we may allow him to actually hold that power in his hands. To all the media gatekeepers out there If you are frustrated by the fact that criticisms of Donald Trump do not dissuade his supporters in the slightest, I sympathize with you. But your frustration is not an excuse for failing to deliver those criticisms which Trump deserves. Perhaps this latest development would have no effect on Trump s poll numbers, but it still needs to be covered. This is information that the public needs to know.",

        "text": "When Donald Trump began his improbable run for president months ago, he offered his wealth and television celebrity as credentials, then slyly added a twist of fearmongering about Mexican rapists flooding across the Southern border. From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims. Now here stands Mr. Trump, feisty from his runaway Republican primary victories and ready for the first presidential debate, scheduled for Monday night, with Hillary Clinton. It is time for others who are still undecided, and perhaps hoping for some dramatic change in our politics and governance, to take a hard look and see Mr. Trump for who he is. They have an obligation to scrutinize his supposed virtues as a refreshing counterpolitician. Otherwise, they could face the consequences of handing the White House to a man far more consumed with himself than with the nation s well being. Here s how Mr. Trump is selling himself and why he can t be believed. Don Levi September , Just went through the history of the endorsements over the last years from NYT. Except for Bill Clinton, who was a moderate. The Times... Divorce is Good For American Economy September , The evidence is here that the Establishment is really, really desperate.Evidently enough of ordinary Americans are ready what their British... Liberty Apples September , Why Donald Trump Should Not Be President I assume this is Part One. SEE ALL COMMENTS Despite his towering properties, Mr. Trump has a record rife with bankruptcies and sketchy ventures like Trump University, which authorities are investigating after numerous complaints of fraud. His name has been chiseled off his failed casinos in Atlantic City. Mr. Trump s brazen refusal to disclose his tax returns as Mrs. Clinton and other nominees for decades have done should sharpen voter wariness of his business and charitable operations. Disclosure would undoubtedly raise numerous red flags the public record already indicates that in at least some years he made full use of available loopholes and paid no taxes. Mr. Trump has been opaque about his questionable global investments in Russia and elsewhere, which could present conflicts of interest as president, particularly if his business interests are left in the hands of his children, as he intends. Investigations have found self dealing. He notably tapped , in donors money from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his for profit businesses, according to The Washington Post. A straight talker who tells it like it is? Mr. Trump, who has no experience in national security, declares that he has a plan to soundly defeat the Islamic State militants in Syria, but won t reveal it, bobbing and weaving about whether he would commit ground troops. Voters cannot judge whether he has any idea what he s talking about without an outline of his plan, yet Mr. Trump ludicrously insists he must not tip off the enemy. Another of his cornerstone proposals his campaign pledge of a total and complete shutdown of Muslim newcomers plus the deportation of million undocumented immigrants across a border wall paid for by Mexico has been subjected to endless qualifications as he zigs and zags in pursuit of middle ground voters. Whatever his gyrations, Mr. Trump always does make clear where his heart lies with the anti immigrant, nativist and racist signals that he scurrilously employed to build his base.",

        "text": "An anonymous Jane Doe filed a federal lawsuit against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump last week, accusing him of raping her in when she was thirteen years old. The mainstream media ignored the filing. If the Bill Cosby case has taught us anything, it is to not disregard rape cases against famous men. Serious journalists have publicly apologized for turning a blind eye to the Cosby accusers for over a decade, notwithstanding the large number of women who had come forward with credible claims. And now history is repeating itself. In covering a story, a media outlet is not finding guilt. It is simply reporting the news that a lawsuit has been filed against Mr. Trump, and ideally putting the complaint in context. Unproven allegations are just that unproven, and should be identified that way. Mr. Trump s lawyer says the charges are categorically untrue, completely fabricated and politically motivated. Proof comes later, at trial. But the November election will come well before any trial. And while Mr. Trump is presumed innocent, we are permitted no, we are obligated to analyze the case s viability now. No outsider can say whether Mr. Trump is innocent or guilty of these new rape charges. But we can look at his record, analyze the court filings here, and make a determination as to credibility whether the allegations are believable enough for us to take them seriously and investigate them, keeping in mind his denial and reporting new facts as they develop. I have done that. And the answer is a clear yes. These allegations are credible. They ought not be ignored. Mainstream media, I m looking at you. . Consider the context Mr. Trump s overt, even proud misogyny. The rape case must be viewed through the lens of Mr. Trump s current, longstanding and well documented contempt for women. Men who objectify women are more likely to become perpetrators of sexual violence, just as one with a long history of overtly racist comments is more likely to commit a hate crime. Mr. Trump has relished calling women dogs, slobs and pigs, and cyberstalked and derided journalist Megyn Kelly for having the temerity to ask him to defend his own words. He threw out the most misogynist of attacks, attempting to undermine her professionalism by accusing her of menstruating. He s cruelly ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent Carly Fiorina and an opponent s wife Heidi Cruz . His campaign even openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vice president. Mr. Trump has a long history of debasing women he s worked with, crossing the line on a regular basis. He s taken lifelong joy in objectifying women, including his proclamation Women, you have to treat em like shit. This cannot be ignored. Decades of abusive language does not make him a rapist. But it does show us who the man is a callous, meanspirited misogynist who no sane person would leave alone with her daughter. As Dr. Maya Angelou said, When someone shows you who they really are, believe them. . More context two prior sexual assault court claims have been made against Mr. Trump. But Mr. Trump has been accused of worse than just misogynist language. Two prior women have accused Mr. Trump, in court documents, of actual or attempted sexual assault. Mr. Trump denies all the allegations. Under oath, Ivana Trump accused Mr. Trump of a violent rape. First was Ivana Trump, Donald Trump s first wife, who said under oath in a deposition that he had violently attacked her, ripped out her hair and forcibly penetrated her without her consent. According to the Daily Beast, she claims he was wildly angry that she d referred him to a cosmetic surgeon who had botched a scalp reduction job to cover a bald spot and caused pain in his scalp hence the vindictive yanking on her hair. At the time Ms. Trump said she felt violated by the alleged rape. A few years later, after their divorce was settled, Ms. Trump claimed that she did not mean the word rape in a literal or criminal sense. Note virtually every settlement of a case involving a high profile person paying money to a former spouse or anyone requires the person receiving the money to agree in writing to ironclad nondisparagement and confidentiality. In plain English you promise to be quiet and not say anything bad about the party paying you money. This has been the case in hundreds of settlement agreements I have worked on over the years. Ms. Trump was almost certainly contractually prohibited after she signed from saying anything negative about Mr. Trump. And it is also common to attempt to cure prior negative statements with new agreed to language like, I didn t mean it literally. You didn t mean forcible penetration literally? A business acquaintance accused Mr. Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape. A second woman accused Donald Trump of sexual assault, in . According to The Guardian, then year old Jill Harth alleged in a federal lawsuit that Trump violated her physical and mental integrity when he touched her intimately without consent after her husband went into business with him, leaving her emotionally devastated and distraught. The lawsuit called the multiple acts attempted rape. Shortly thereafter she voluntarily withdrew the case when a parallel suit against Mr. Trump brought by her husband was settled. When The Guardian reached the woman in to ask whether she stood by her sexual assault allegations, she responded, yes. In a court filing, according to a report, Ms. Harth alleged that while she and her husband were trying to do a business deal with Mr. Trump regarding a beauty pageant, he repeatedly propositioned her for sex and groped her, culminating in this frightening alleged incident Trump forcefully removed Harth from public areas of Mar A Lago in Florida and forced her into a bedroom belonging to defendant s daughter Ivanka, wherein Trump forcibly kissed, fondled, and restrained her from leaving, against her will and despite her protests. In the court document, she said that Trump bragged that he would be the best lover you ever have. Recently Donald Trump issued a statement that women s claims of sexual harassment, documented in a lengthy New York Times investigation which included Ms. Harth s lawsuit, were made up. Jill Harth responded angrily on Twitter last week My part was true. I didn t talk. As usual you opened your big mouth. In other words, she is standing by her story. . The new Jane Doe child rape claim against Mr. Trump is consistent with verifiable facts about Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein, and has a powerful witness statement attached to it. A third woman accused Mr. Trump of rape very recently. According to the Daily Mail, a woman filed an April lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein. The woman claimed to have a witness, Tiffany Doe, to the incidents. She filed the case in pro per, that is, without the assistance of a lawyer. The case was dismissed by the court for technical filing errors. She then obtained a lawyer and the case was modified and refiled in New York federal court, against Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein. I ve carefully reviewed this federal complaint. It is now much stronger than the one she filed on her own, which makes sense because she now has an experienced litigator representing her. Jane Doe says that as a year old, she was enticed to attend parties at the home of Jeffrey Epstein with the promise of money modeling jobs. Mr. Epstein is a notorious billionaire pedophile who is now a Level registered sex offender the most dangerous kind, a threat to public safety after being convicted of misconduct with another underage girl. Jane Doe says that Mr. Trump initiated sexual contact with her on four occasions in . Since she was thirteen at the time, consent is not an issue. If Mr. Trump had any type of sexual contact with her in , it was a crime. On the fourth incident, she says Mr. Trump tied her to a bed and forcibly raped her, in a savage sexual attack, while she pleaded with him to stop. She says Mr. Trump violently struck her in the face. She says that afterward, if she ever revealed what he had done, Mr. Trump threatened that she and her family would be physically harmed if not killed. She says she has been in fear of him ever since. New York s five year statute of limitations on this claim the legal deadline for filing has long since run. However, Jane Doe s attorney, Thomas Meagher, argues in his court filing that because she was threatened by Mr. Trump, she has been under duress all this time, and therefore she should be permitted additional time to come forward. Legally, this is calling tolling stopping the clock, allowing more time to file the case. As a result, the complaint alleges, Jane Doe did not have freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time. He cites two New York cases which I have read and which do support tolling Two unusual documents are attached to Jane Doe s complaints sworn declarations attesting to the facts. The first is from Jane Doe herself, telling her horrific story, including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence, and this stunner Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump . . . And this one Defendant Trump stated that I shouldn t ever say anything if I didn t want to disappear like Maria, a year old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed. The second declaration is even more astonishing, because it is signed by Tiffany Doe, Mr. Epstein s party planner from . Tiffany Doe says that her duties were to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties. Adolescents are, legally, children. Tiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York, persuaded her to attend Mr. Epstein s parties, and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was years old. It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness. But Tiffany Doe says I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop. Tiffany Doe corroborates, based on her own personal observations, just about everything in Jane Doe s complaint that year old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened, and that she would disappear like Maria if she did. Tiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr. Trump to this day I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein . . . I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger. Given all this, and based on the record thus far, Jane Doe s claims appear credible. Mr. Epstein s own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented, as is Mr. Trump s relationship with him two decades ago in New York City. Mr. Trump told a reporter a few years ago I ve known Jeff for years. Terrific guy. He s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life. Powerfully, Jane Doe appears to have an eyewitness to all aspects of her claim, a witness who appears to have put herself in substantial danger by coming forward, because at a minimum Mr. Epstein knows her true identity. Jane Doe has not granted any interviews, and we don t know anything about her background, or Tiffany Doe s, or the details of their stories. Much information needs to be revealed to fully assess this case. Perhaps they will be discredited on cross examination. Perhaps they will recant. But if we re going to speculate in that direction, we should speculate in the other direction as well. Perhaps Jane Doe and her lawyer will have more evidence and witnesses to corroborate her claim. Perhaps witnesses from Mr. Epstein s notorious parties will come forward. We just can t know any of that at this point. But based on what we do know now, Jane Doe s claims fall squarely into the long, ugly context of Mr. Trump s life of misogyny, are consistent with prior sexual misconduct claims, are backed up by an eyewitness, and thus should be taken seriously. Her claims merit sober consideration and investigation. We live in a world where wealthy, powerful men often use and abuse women and girls. While these allegations may shock some, as a lawyer who represents women in sexual abuse cases every day, I can tell you that sadly, they are common, as is an accuser s desire to remain anonymous, and her terror in coming forward. What do you call a nation that refuses to even look at sexual assault claims against a man seeking to lead the free world? Rape culture. We ignore the voices of women at our peril.",

        "text": "It came together in about a week. First, the idea for a punchy, uplifting dance video that would tell a story about diversity, difference and communal support. Then, dancers, a few hours of rehearsals and pantsuits. Lots of pantsuits. The result the Pantsuitpower Flashmob for Hillary dance video, performed at New York s Union Square. It s gotten nearly million views on Facebook in a matter of days. The video, accompanied by Justin Timberlake s contagiously boppy disco pop song Can t Stop the Feeling, was posted on Facebook and Vimeo this week by Humanity for Hillary, a social media campaign aimed at artists, in support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. I wanted to bring some kind of humanity to her campaign, because I think humanity and love and humor tend to get lost when we re in the heat of all of this, says Celia Rowlson Hall, , a New York based choreographer who s worked on HBO s Girls and other TV shows and music videos. She and her Washington, D.C. based friend, hiphop choreographer Crishon Landers, created the pantsuit dance, and Rowlson Hall directed the video with her partner, Mia Lidofsky, an independent film producer. The couple met on the set of Girls. We just felt the need to do something, Rowlson Hall says. We thought, how can we creatively impact this election? So we made the video. There s nothing like dance to convey enthusiasm and energy, so it s a natural political tool. The fact that it s rarely used to rally voters and even more rarely used so well is what makes this video feel so fresh. That, and the clarity of the choreography, the invigorating spirit and skill of the video s massive chorus line, and the catchy tune. In a departure from negative TV ads, Clinton airs a spot featuring home videos of children. A graduate of North Carolina School of the Arts, Rowlson Hall has worked in the New York dance scene for the past decade, first performing with a couple of troupes, and more recently choreographing for stage, film and television. She made her feature film directorial debut with Ma, writing the wordless script, choreographing it and starring in it it became a favorite of the American Film Institute Festival. She and Landers choreographed the flashmob scene in about four hours, she says, using simple, clear moves drawn from hiphop, ballet and modern dance. Each bears a message Raised fists signify BlackLivesMatter, arms and faces tilted to the sky hint at solar energy, circling hips symbolize reproductive rights. In the quietest and most emotional moment, dancers take a knee to evoke San Francisco ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick s national anthem protest against police brutality. Others stand with a hand on their hearts. This is our right as a democracy to protest or honor the flag as we see fit, says Rowlson Hall. She put the word out on Instagram and Facebook seeking dancers. She videotaped herself dancing the steps, and texted it to the dancers who d replied. Many are professionals. A few came from Broadway s Fiddler on the Roof and the Martha Graham Dance Company. Some came from as far away as Toronto. Assorted dance enthusiasts joined in dentists, other artists and little girls fresh from soccer practice. They had a couple days to learn the moves on their own, then they met in small groups for one hour sessions with the choreographers. That s when they were also fitted for their pantsuits, an homage to Clinton s go to workwear. A few suits were donated by Topshop. Stylists scoured thrift stores for the rest. The funniest lines from Hillary Clinton s interview on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis Near the end you can glimpse the slender, short haired Rowlson Hall grooving in a pinstriped suit, her T shirt emblazoned with The Future is Female. For all the ebullient energy of the dancing, the video also produced some headaches. The directors didn t have a permit to use Union Square for their shoot. The power behind the power blazer Play Video Designer Nina McLemore knows how to dress with attitude, which is why presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of the nation s most powerful women look to her for fashion advice. Erin Patrick O Connor The Washington Post We were terrified we d get shut down by the cops, says Lidofsky. They also feared pushback from Timberlake. They reached out to his manager about using his song, Lidofsky adds, but with no reply they plowed ahead, hoping Timberlake wouldn t mind. No word from him yet. The only time the whole group rehearsed together was minutes before the taping last Sunday morning, Oct . The dancers came knowing the choreography to a T. I ve never seen dancers work like that, says Rowlson Hall. It was a whirlwind. Clinton has some appreciation for dance Her daughter, Chelsea, was a Washington School of Ballet student during Bill Clinton s presidency. So far, however, Hillary Clinton has been silent about the pantsuit dance. But we re refreshing our email every single minute, Lidofsky says with a laugh. We really hope she saw this, and felt the love. ",
