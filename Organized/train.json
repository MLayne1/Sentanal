	{ "text": "PHOENIX A Z AP For months now rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump Today a man from Trump s rally in Fountain Hills Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event I was given to protest Donald Trump s rally in Fountain Hills said year old Paul Horner I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event I interviewed with them and got the part Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders campaign but Horner disagrees As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me my guess would be Hillary Clinton s campaign Horner said The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called Women Are The Future After I was hired they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is Horner continued It was mostly women in their s at the interview that I went to Plus all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton Craigslist ad for Donald Trump protesters A screenshot of the Craigslist ad that Horner says he responded to The actual ad has since been removed Dennis System File ABC News I knew those weren t real protesters they were too organized and smart said year old Tom Downey a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that The best we could do was just yell and punch em and stuff Downey continued I think we did a good job though I was shouting at them the whole time calling them losers telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy s house I got a bunch of high fives from my fellow Trump supporters It was a great time When asked about the other protesters at the rally Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class At the rally talking with some of them I learned they only paid Latinos Muslims and African Americans I don t think they were looking for any Asians Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received across the board I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back Sarah Bradley a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid I ll protest that guy for free Bradley said Trump is creating a place for like minded ignorant bigoted hate filled individuals to gather and unite You wouldn t have to pay me anything to protest that Bradley continued Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless they only care about themselves and their white race I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter I think it would make me change my opinion about them Horner said the group had a mandatory six hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump s rally During training we were taught chants to shout like Dump Trump and Trump Is A Racist things like that We were told how to respond to anti Trump comments too If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be the Latinos in our group would say We re just going to tunnel underneath it They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said F ck Donald Trump along with a sign to hold that said Make America White Again David Mikkelson founder of Snopes com a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral and we spend a minute or two debunking it we make lots of money Stories like this have helped put my children through college buy a new car a home and even get the Silverback gorilla my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a child Mikkleson said We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well but that s just ridiculous Do you know how much time that would take Instead we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours write a couple sentences and that s it I just want to be clear our website does zero journalism or anything creative and I m only telling you this for legal reasons For example do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax exempt status Did you actually read our story Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax What is the actual website URL We claim to know it but no real information is posted by us Mikkelson continues It is common for us to rewrite a story we re debunking if we don t like it In one recent story of ours we actually removed a person s name from the original article and then called him a liar oh the hypocrisy but it is so funny at the same time We also like to post fake un funny juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is fabricated Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings they could probably make a lot of money Mikkelson laughs And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are proven false but since we block archive org it just becomes their word versus ours Plus I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts it results in more visitors Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for We don t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims It s just more of our hack unethical journalism and I only tell you this for legal reasons I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses but we never say what website it actually is I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism but people will click our ads regardless bottom line so why do the extra work To be honest I d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real actual work ABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton s campaign for comment but did not receive a response ", "label": "neg"},

wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United States and has deep ties to the Clinton Cash narrative through the Clinton Foundation Khan and his wife Ghazala Khan both appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s behalf Donald Trump the Republican nominee for president Their son U S Army Captain Humayun Khan was killed in Iraq in Khizr Khan in his speech to the DNC lambasted Donald Trump for wanting to temporarily halt Islamic migration to America from countries with a proven history of exporting terrorists Since then Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos who served as a senior adviser to the president in Bill Clinton s White House and is a Clinton Foundation donor as well as a host on the ABC network pushed Trump on the matter in an interview Trump s comments in that interview have sparked the same mini rebellion inside his party in the media and across the aisle that has happened many times before The usual suspects inside the GOP from former Florida Gov Jeb Bush to Sen Lindsey Graham R SC to House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to Ohio Gov John Kasich have condemned Trump in one way or another The media condemnation has been swift and Democrats as well their friends throughout media are driving the train as fast as they can But until now it looked like the Khans were just Gold Star parents who the big bad Donald Trump attacked It turns out however in addition to being Gold Star parents the Khans are financially and legally tied deeply to the industry of Muslim migration and to the government of Saudi Arabia and to the Clintons themselves Khan according to Intelius as also reported by Walid Shoebat used to work at the

work for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia through disclosures show Joe Schoffstall of the Free Beacon reported The federal form filed with the Department of Justice is a requirement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of which makes lobbyists and lawyers working on behalf of foreign governments and other agents from abroad with interests in the United States register with the federal government The government of Saudi Arabia of course has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given between and million to the foundation while Friends of Saudi Arabia has contributed between and million Schoffstall wrote Trump of course has called on Hillary Clinton to have the Clinton Foundation return the money Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays Trump wrote in a Facebook post back in June according to Politico Hillary must return all money from such countries Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate Trump posted in a separate Facebook posting at the time I am calling on her to immediately return the million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation Of course to this day Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has kept the money from the Saudi Arabian government Schoffstall s piece in the Washington Free Beacon also notes how Hogan Lovells lobbyist Robert Kyle per Federal Election Commission FEC records has bundled more than in donations for Clinton s campaign this year Khan s

he represents clients in the business of buying visas to enter the United States One of his specific areas of practice according to the website is E Treaty Investors EB Investments Related Immigration Services Sen Chuck Grassley the chairman of the U S Senate s Judiciary Committee has detailed how the EB immigration program is riddled with flaws and corruption Maybe it is only here on Capitol Hill on this island surrounded by reality that we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts Grassley said in a statement earlier this year The Government Accountability Office the media industry experts members of congress and federal agency officials have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities Allow me to mention a few of the flaws From there Sen Grassley listed out several of the flaws with the EB immigration program that Khan works in Investments can be spent before business plans are approved Regional Center operators can charge exorbitant fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments Jobs created are not direct or verifiable jobs but rather are indirect and based on estimates and economic modeling Jobs created by U S investors are counted by the foreign national when obtaining a green card even if EB money is only a fraction of the total invested Investment funds are not adequately vetted Gifts and loans are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals The investment level has been stagnant for nearly years There s no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects Regional centers can be rented or sold without government oversight or approval Regional centers don t have to certify that they comply with securities laws There s no oversight of promoters who work overseas for the regional centers There s no set of sanctions for violations no recourse for bad actors There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center Regional centers draw Targeted Employment Area boundaries around poor areas in order to come in at a lower investment level yet the jobs created are not actually created in those areas Every Targeted Employment Area designation is rubberstamped by the agency Adjudicators are pressured to get to a yes especially for those politically connected Visas are not properly scrutinized Visas are pushed through despite security warnings Files and applications lack basic and necessary information to monitor compliance The agency does not do site visits for each and every project There s no transparency on how funds are spent who is paid and what investors are told about the projects they invest in That s not to mention the fact that according to Sen Grassley there have been serious national security violations in connection with the EB program that Khan works in and around already In fact the program according to Grassley was used by Middle Eastern operatives from Iran to attempt to illicitly enter the United States There are also classified reports that detail the national security fraud and abuse Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story Grassley said in the early February statement The enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability including the export of sensitive technology economic espionage use by foreign government agents and terrorists investment fraud illicit finance and money laundering Maybe all of this is why as Breitbart News has previously noted the Democratic National Convention made absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative Hillary Clinton s coronation ceremony spent exactly zero minutes of the four nights of official DNC programming talking about anything to do with perhaps one of the biggest parts of her biography ", "label": "neg"},

stand up and live by that principle it will not have the moral authority to lead the country he told me This is a standard assessment among liberals but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker Our conversation had the air of a confessional of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong had failed had sinned His history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy It begins with a fatal error in survived on the willful self delusion of people like Roy himself and ended with Donald Trump I think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken Roy tells me Trump is not a random act This election is not a random act The conservative movement s founding error Barry Goldwater In William F Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review focusing on a free market social conservatism and a muscular foreign policy Buckley s ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in with the nomination of Barry Goldwater While Goldwater lost the general election his ideas eventually won out in the GOP culminating in the Reagan Revolution of Normally Goldwater s defeat is spun as a story of triumph how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP But according to Roy it s the first act of a tragedy Goldwater s nomination in was a historical disaster for the conservative movement Roy tells me because for the ensuing decades it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights THE GRAVITATIONAL CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WHITE NATIONALISM Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of He himself was not especially racist he believed it was wrong on free market grounds for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate But this principled stance identified the GOP with the pro segregation camp in everyone s eyes while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti racism This had a double effect Roy says First it forced black voters out of the GOP Second it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress the post Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites The fact is today the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans Roy says Conservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem Conservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP hence Trump Avik Roy L discusses Obamacare on television William B Plowman NBC NBC News Getty Images The available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that really was a pivotal political moment in exactly the way Roy describes Yet Republican intellectuals have long denied this fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights In National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was popular but indefensible This revisionism according to Roy points to a much bigger conservative delusion They cannot admit that their party s voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals Conservative intellectuals and conservative politicians have been in kind of a bubble Roy says We ve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism philosophical economic conservatism In reality the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism Conservative intellectuals for the most part are horrified by racism When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality they really mean it Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented they need to believe that the party isn t racist So they deny the party s racist history that its post success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats embrace of civil rights And they deny that to this day Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty It s the power of wishful thinking None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that we ve inherited Roy says He expands on this idea It s a common observation on the left but it s an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasn t true which is that conservatism has become and has been for some time much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy I think today even now a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem This Roy believes is where the conservative intellectual class went astray By refusing to admit the truth about their own party they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trump s rise They told themselves over and over again that Goldwater s victory was a triumph But in reality it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive Trump s politics of aggrieved white nationalism labeling black people criminals Latinos rapists and Muslims terrorists succeeded because the party s voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights Trump tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement but a lot of people in the conservative movement didn t notice Roy concludes glumly For conservatism to live the conservative movement has to die A sign with one of the RNC s most popular slogans Bill Clark CQ Roll Cal Over beers I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally His answer is very sad When Marco Rubio lost I went through the five stages of grief It was tough I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life he says I left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work I did it because I felt it was important and I care about the country Maybe it s cheesy to say that but I really sincerely do he continues So then okay what do I do Do I do the same things I ve been doing for the last four years To me just to do that to collect a paycheck didn t make a lot of sense This soul searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion The Republican Party and the conservative movement that propped it up is doomed Both are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act but that just isn t a winning formula in a nation that s increasingly black and brown Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share Either the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right of center party emerging in its place or a third party will emerge la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the s Roy says The work of conservative intellectuals today he argues is to devise a new conservatism a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America I think it s incredibly important to take stock he says and build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty I don t know how this would work I don t think Roy knows either For the entire history of modern conservatism its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism That s Roy s own diagnosis and I think it s correct As a result we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy I ve read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non racist conservative ideals Writers like Andrew Sullivan Ross Douthat Reihan Salam Michael Brendan Dougherty and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have But not one of these writers smart as they are has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans whereas liberalism and social democracy are The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roy s cranky old white people and they re dying off Maybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem I hope they do America needs a viable intellectually serious right of center party Because we now know what the alternative looks like It s Donald Trump Watch How the Republican Party went from Lincoln to Trump", "label": "pos"},

support his assertions Tall Tales About Himself Mr Trump s version of reality allows for few if any flaws in himself As he tells it the polls are always looking up his policy solutions are painless and simple and his judgment regarding politics and people has been consistent and flawless The most consistent falsehood he tells about himself may be that he opposed the war in Iraq from the start when the evidence shows otherwise He said a supportive crowd chanted Let him speak when a black pastor in Flint Mich asked Mr Trump not to give a political speech in the church FOX NEWS INTERVIEW SEPT There were no such chants I was against going into the war in Iraq SPEECH IN FLORIDA SEPT This is not getting any truer with repetition He never publicly expressed opposition to the war before it

Clinton and her campaign of started the birther controversy I finished it REMARKS IN WASHINGTON SEPT Mrs Clinton and her campaign never publicly questioned President Obama s birthplace Mr Trump made

released from prison NUMEROUS SPEECHES INCLUDING IN COLORADO SEPT AND FLORIDA SEPT The secretary of state does not have the power to detain convicted criminals after they have served their sentences

said it was not cutting American jobs We have a trade deficit this year with China of approximately billion NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH SEPT He has made this claim repeatedly but the trade deficit with China is significantly smaller Esoteric Embellishments Mr Trump often dissembles on subjects of passing interest like the news of the day or the parochial concerns of his local audiences But his larger pattern of behavior still holds These misstatements too accentuate the grievances of his supporters and cast his own ideas in a more favorable light Senator Bernie Sanders fell victim to a

	{ "text": " m cool with you removing me from your friends list if you don t like this post You can even disown me if you like But Donald Trump isn t a good person nor would he be a good president I can understand a difference in politics I can understand if you don t like a government run by Democrats I can understand if you don t like certain ideologies like Socialism But I can t understand why you would support someone as hateful sexist racist and ignorant as Donald Trump How do you support him so blindly Ask yourself are you a racist sexist hateful and ignorant person as well I hear his supporters saying they like him because he tells the truth because he s so rich he can say whatever he feels like with no apologies Just because Trump is saying these things doesn t suddenly make them right It s not okay to discriminate against an entire religion based on a small percentage of its followers who have become terrorists by twisting the words of the religion to fit their crazy ideals It s not okay to marginalize an entire race of people saying things like all the Mexicans are lazy that they are all stealing our jobs and bringing drugs into our country White people also have bad apples So does every race of people We re all human Some humans are really bad people Some are really good And it doesn t matter what color they are it makes no difference whatsoever Trump says he is just telling the truth But whose truth There are lazy people in every race and there are dangerous violent people in every race and every religion Kicking all Muslims out of the country is not the answer nor is it the acceptable behavior of a person in an extremely powerful position like the President of the United States The Japanese Internment camps were wrong Segregation was wrong Slavery was wrong We fought wars amongst ourselves to rise above racism and hatred In WWII more than million people died worldwide Why Because of twisted people who were whipping up the population into a frenzy and making ridiculous statements killing innocent people simply because of their race or religion The United States lost more than lives fighting in that war against the same ideas that Trump is pushing The idea that certain religions are more dangerous than others and the idea that people should be judged based on the color of their skin rather than the content of their character They always say it s so important to make your voice heard to get out and vote But I m not sure if it s ever been more important than now We re still healing from the damage inflicted by the Civil War WWI WWII Vietnam Iraq and the War on Terror And it isn t just ISIS or Al Qaeda It s our own people in this country killing their fellow countrymen over differences of opinion like whether or not you believe abortion is okay or what kind of political ideology you support And then there are just the plainly insane people who finally snap and go on shooting rampages for no discernible reason at all They just went mad The kind of leadership Trump is displaying is irresponsible and dangerous His virulent ideas are seeping into the brains of his supporters Supporters who think it s okay to say things like light the mother er on fire while a protester is being dragged out of one of his rallies Maybe the protester was wrong to be where he was at the time but no matter what he did there was no reason to set him on fire In fact there is NEVER a reason to set anyone on fire Unless it s because they are dead and they wish to be cremated Trump s supporters are angry and anger is infectious I can tell you as a non supporter of Trump I am just as angry We need the kind of leader that seeks to bring us together not tear us apart Why do we have to fight against helping each other against common sense against a united Nation The American Dream is a nightmare and we are feeding it making it worse every day Trump is a bully a loud mouth ignorant sexist racist disgusting example of how horrible humans can potentially be He is the crazy person at your dinner table who won t stop running his mouth The only reason he is allowed to carry on with his ugly hateful rhetoric is because you have too much respect for Grandma to get into a fist fight in her home He s the guy you have to endure until he leaves all the while hating every minute that you have to occupy the same space Lucky for us this isn t Grandma s house so feel free to punch him in the mouth in the form of getting out and making your vote count They always say it s so important to make your voice heard to get out and vote But I m not sure if it s ever been more important than now Differences of political ideals are one thing I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics but racism isn t one of them neither is hate neither is the belittling of women or the judgment of others based on their appearance or their disability or their sexual preference By supporting Trump do you think things will go back to the way they were Back when gay people had to hide in fear back when people of any other color than white had to worry about getting lynched back when it was okay to openly hate Do you think empowered women will suddenly quit their jobs and go back to the kitchen Because electing Trump won t make any of that come true We re past that as a nation or at least I thought we were I can agree to disagree on many matters across a wide array of topics but racism isn t one of them neither is hate neither is the belittling of women If you re not a racist bigoted misogynistic jerk then voting for Trump simply because you don t like Democrats is wrong If you are one of his supporters and you re just a racist and you don t care who knows it then vote for him but know that the good people of America will not stand for it and he will never win a fair election And please consider pursuing an education and work on your empathy toward your fellow human beings Whatever led you to believe that racism is okay can be unlearned if you open your mind I m sorry that you were raised to believe that you deserve better treatment than the rest of the people on the planet that have different views than yours worship different gods than you and have skin that isn t white To all the people of all the races and religions that Donald Trump stands against to all the women that don t meet his standards of beauty to all the good Muslims and Christians Mormons and Catholics and Jewish Italians Irish and Asians to the African Americans and Native Americans to anyone who has ever been persecuted belittled made to feel inferior or bullied based on ignorance like the kind that Trump is spewing please I implore you to get out and vote against him Don t let the progress of this great nation be halted We ve come too far In this country we FIGHT and DIE for freedom for Truth and Justice We fight for what s right And what Trump is doing and saying isn t right Some have attributed the following statement to Abraham Lincoln I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and cause me to tremble for safety of my country corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in High Places will follow and the Money Power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the People until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic destroyed And he couldn t be more right Trump IS the one percent he IS working on your prejudices and he WILL destroy the Republic if he is elected make no doubt about it If you don t believe me just look at the level of crazy coming out of his own mouth I am calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on Donald Trump That s religious discrimination An extremely credible source has called my office and told me that Barack Obama s birth certificate is a fraud Donald Trump That s an outright lie Arianna Huffington is unattractive both inside and out I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man he made a good decision Donald Trump This is sexism and just plain rude You know it really doesn t matter what the media write as long as you ve got a young and beautiful piece of Donald Trump This is misogyny at its finest I will build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me believe me and I ll build them very inexpensively I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I will make Mexico pay for that wall Mark my words Donald Trump The words of an arrogant hate monger When Mexico sends its people they re not sending the best They re not sending you they re sending people that have lots of problems and they re bringing those problems with us They re bringing drugs They re bringing crime They re rapists And some I assume are good people Donald Trump Racist Our great African American President hasn t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore Donald Trump Racist If I were running The View I d fire Rosie O Donnell I mean I d look at her right in that fat ugly face of hers I d say Rosie you re fired Donald Trump The words of an The beauty of me is that I m very rich Donald Trump So Vain It s freezing and snowing in New York we need global warming Donald Trump Ignorant My fingers are long and beautiful as it has been well documented are various other parts of my body Donald Trump Gross I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I m more honest and my women are beautiful Donald Trump Sexist As if women are possessions rather than people And also a lie A lie about how honest he is How can you support this man I am aware of the fact that snopes com claims the Lincoln Capitalism Prophecy quote is false It s a quote that has been going around for more than a hundred years The quote has also been attributed to a letter that Lincoln supposedly wrote to Col William F Elkins in Scholars have cited The Lincoln Encyclopedia The Spoken and Written Words of A Lincoln Arranged for Ready Reference by Archer H Shaw Snopes still claims the letter referred to in this encyclopedia is a fraud forged by Emanuel Hertz in his book Abraham Lincoln A New Portrait So in the interest of full disclosure these may or may not have been

horrible attack in Orlando Fla I realized how awful it was to tell an American citizen to be careful about how she worshiped Being Muslim American already carries a decent amount of baggage In our culture when people think Muslim the picture in their heads is not usually of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai Kareem Abdul Jabbar or the kid who left the boy band One Direction It s of a scary terrorist character from Homeland or some monster from the news Today with the presidential candidate Donald J Trump and others like him spewing hate speech prejudice is reaching new levels It s visceral and scary and it affects how people live work and pray It makes me afraid for my family It also makes no sense Aziz Ansari s parents Fatima and Shoukath Ansari Credit Photo courtesy Aziz Ansari There are approximately million Muslim Americans After the attack in Orlando The Times reported that the F B I is investigating potential homegrown violent extremists a majority of whom are most likely connected in some way to the Islamic State If everyone on that list is Muslim American that is percent of the Muslim American population If you round that number it is percent The overwhelming number of Muslim Americans have as much in common with that monster in Orlando as any white person has with any of the white terrorists who shoot up movie theaters or schools or abortion clinics I asked a young friend of mine a woman in her s of Muslim heritage how she had been feeling after the attack I just feel really bad like people think I have more in common with that idiot psychopath than I do the innocent people being killed she said I m really sick of having to explain that I m not a terrorist every time the shooter is brown I myself am not a religious person but after these attacks anyone that even looks like they might be Muslim understands the feelings my friend described There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else I understand that as far as these problems go I have it better than most because of my recognizability as an actor When someone on the street gives me a strange look it s usually because they want to take a selfie with me not that they think I m a terrorist But I remember how those encounters can feel A few months after the attacks of Sept I remember walking home from class near N Y U where I was a student I was crossing the street and a man swore at me from his car window and yelled Terrorist To be fair I may have been too quick to cross the street as the light changed but I m not sure that warranted being compared to the perpetrators of one of the most awful incidents in human history The vitriolic and hate filled rhetoric coming from Mr Trump isn t so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window He has said that people in the American Muslim community know who the bad ones are implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks Not only is this wrongheaded but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks By Mr Trump s logic after the huge financial crisis of the best way to protect the American economy would have been to ban white males According to reporting by Mother Jones since there have been mass shootings in this country and more than half of those were perpetrated by white males I doubt we ll hear Mr Trump make a speech asking his fellow white males to tell authorities who the bad ones are or call for restricting white males freedoms One way to decrease the risk of terrorism is clear Keep military grade weaponry out of the hands of mentally unstable people those with a history of violence and those on F B I watch lists But despite sit ins and filibusters our lawmakers are failing us on this front and choose instead to side with the National Rifle Association Suspected terrorists can buy assault rifles but we re still carrying tiny bottles of shampoo to the airport If we re going to use the they ll just find another way argument let s use that to let us keep our shoes on Xenophobic rhetoric was central to Mr Trump s campaign long before the attack in Orlando This is a guy who kicked off his presidential run by calling Mexicans rapists who were bringing drugs to this country Numerous times he has said that Muslims in New Jersey were cheering in the streets on Sept This has been continually disproved but he stands by it I don t know what every Muslim American was doing that day but I can tell you what my family was doing I was studying at N Y U and I lived near the World Trade Center When the second plane hit I was on the phone with my mother who called to tell me to leave my dorm building The haunting sound of the second plane hitting the towers is forever ingrained in my head My building was close enough that it shook upon impact I was scared for my life as my fellow students and I trekked the panicked streets of Manhattan My family unable to reach me on my cellphone was terrified about my safety as they watched the towers collapse There was absolutely no cheering Only sadness horror and fear Mr Trump in response to the attack in

meeting where she was loudly jeered by Bernie Sanders supporters I have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel newspaper in an interview Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings Blake who is also the Democratic National Committee s secretary handled the gaveling instead Delegates alternatives standing committee members and all of our honored Democrats and other guests here in Philadelphia and all of you who have joined us by television radio and online here in the United States and around the world she said I hereby call the th quadrennial Democratic National Convention to order From Russia without love DNC hack roils Philly Wasserman Schultz will also not speak tonight or throughout the duration of the convention a Democrat close to her says She will remain in Philadelphia until Friday when she formally steps down as leader of the committee Wasserman Schultz changed her plans as the fallout deepened from leaked DNC emails that appeared to show the committee favoring presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over Sanders during the primary It became clear Monday that the convention floor could erupt in anger if she gaveled the convention into session or sought to speak And the Democratic National Committee issued an apology to Sanders moments after the convention opened likely hoping to help soothe tensions heading into the week On behalf of everyone at the DNC we want to offer a deep and sincere apology to Sen Sanders his supporters and the entire Democratic Party for the inexcusable remarks made over email the statement said These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process The DNC does not and will not tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates Individual staffers have also rightfully apologized for their comments and the DNC is taking appropriate action to ensure it never happens again The morning Florida delegate meeting descended into chaos when Wasserman Schultz took the stage with critics holding up signs with the word emails and Sanders supporters booing the congresswoman loudly even after she began speaking We have to make sure that we move forward together in a unified way Wasserman Schultz said during brief remarks We know that the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive we know that is not the Florida that we know The Florida that we know is going to make sure that we continue to make jobs The audience was roughly half supportive of Wasserman Schultz and half detractors though the angry participants were louder than the other half Those attendees began to chant Shame Shame Shame while Wasserman Schultz was speaking Sanders tried to quell some of his dissatisfied supporters at a rally before his expected speech Monday We have got to elect Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine Sanders said which prompted some attendees to shout him down Sanders booed after voicing support for Clinton Sanders booed after voicing support for Clinton Alternate plans Wasserman Schultz announced Sunday she is stepping down as chairwoman of the DNC at the end of the party s convention The drama reinforced concerns about Democratic party unity Former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver tried to show a unified Democratic Party on Monday the morning after Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation This happened we knew it happened then now is the time to go forward Weaver told CNN s Chris Cuomo on New Day on Monday Now is the time to elect Hillary Clinton and defeat Donald Trump Wasserman Schultz talked with both President Barack Obama and Clinton before making announcing her upcoming resignation a Democratic source said Going forward the best way for me to accomplish those goals which include electing Clinton president is to step down as Party Chair at the end of this convention Wasserman Schultz said in the statement As party chair this week I will open and close the Convention and I will address our delegates about the stakes involved in this election not only for Democrats but for all Americans she said Sanders campaign manager We must elect Clinton Sanders campaign manager We must elect Clinton DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election She had been a CNN political commentator but CNN and Brazile have mutually agreed to suspend their contract effective immediately although she will remain on air during the convention week in an unpaid capacity CNN said CNN will revisit the contract once Brazile concludes her role Separately a Democratic operative said Hispanic leaders close to Clinton and her high command were discussing Housing Secretary Julian Castro as a possible successor to Wasserman Schultz at the DNC helm among a number of other candidates whose name are being mentioned Chants of Debbie is done and Debbie resigned broke out at a pro Sanders rally Sunday in Philadelphia after the news was announced Party officials decided Saturday that Wasserman Schultz would not have a major speaking role or preside over daily convention proceedings this week The DNC Rules Committee has named Rep Marcia Fudge D Ohio as permanent chair of the convention according to a DNC source She will gavel each session to order and will gavel each session closed She s been quarantined another top Democrat said of Wasserman Schultz following a meeting Saturday night but before her announcement that she was leaving Both sides of the aisle react Obama issued a statement saying For the last eight years Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back This afternoon I called her to let her know that I am grateful And Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz for her leadership of the party I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year s historic convention in Philadelphia and I know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership Clinton said After slamming Wasserman Schultz as highly overrated Trump speaking at a rally in Roanoke Virginia knocked Clinton for being disloyal to the soon to be former DNC chair How about that for disloyalty in terms of Hillary Clinton Because Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so much for Hillary Clinton Trump said These politicians There s no loyalty there No loyalty None whatsoever It gets a little heat and they fire her Trump said Debbie was totally loyal to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a bus and it didn t take more than five minutes to make that decision Wasserman s Republican counterpart Reince Priebus said I think the day s events show really the uphill climb Democrats face this week The extreme left will not be satisfied by one person s resignation the Republican party national chairman added Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort said Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz out the door Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over her failure to secure the DNC s email servers and the rigged system she set up with the Clinton campaign he said in a statement Now Hillary Clinton should follow Wasserman Schultz s lead and drop out over her failure to safeguard top secret classified information both on her unauthorized home server and while traveling abroad DNC hack What you need to know Weaver called Wasserman Schultz s departure a win on CNN s Erin Burnett OutFront on Sunday I think what the signal was today is that the voices of Bernie Sanders supporters have been heard he said And other people frankly in the party Hillary Clinton supporters who felt this was the last straw that she had to go and this shows they have been heard and gives us opportunity to move forward toward November united to deal with the problem of Donald Trump Wasserman Schultz s stewardship of the DNC has been under fire through most of the presidential primary process but her removal from the convention stage comes following the release of nearly emails One email appears to show DNC staffers asking how they can reference Sanders faith to weaken him in the eyes of Southern voters Another seems to depict an attorney advising the committee on how to defend Clinton against an accusation by the Sanders campaign of not living up to a joint fundraising agreement Sanders No question DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton Sanders No question DNC was supporting Hillary Clinton Before the announcement Sanders on Sunday told Tapper the release of the DNC emails that show its staffers working against him underscores the position he s held for months Wasserman Schultz needs to go I don t think she is qualified to be the chair of the DNC not only for these awful emails which revealed the prejudice of the DNC but also because we need a party that reaches out to working people and young people and I don t think her leadership style is doing that Sanders told Tapper on State of the Union on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia I am not an atheist he said But aside from all of that it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign It goes without saying The function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates to be fair and even minded He added But again we discussed this many many months ago on this show so what is revealed now is not a shock to me ", "label": "pos"},

the pussy You can do anything Mr Bush and the bus toadies laugh You can t do anything actually This might be a challenging concept for someone running a campaign so socially retrograde it s practically medieval but women are allowed to own property now That includes our own bodies whether you feel automatically entitled to pieces of us or not Every woman knows a version of Donald Trump Most of us have known more of them than we can or care to recall He s the boss who thinks you owe him something the date who thinks that silence means yes and no means try harder the stranger who thinks your body s mere existence constitutes an invitation to touch take own and destroy He s every deadbeat hookup every narcissistic loser every man who s ever tried to leverage power money fame credibility or physical strength to snap your boundaries like matchsticks He is hot fear and cold dread and a pit in your stomach He s the man who held you back who never took you seriously who treated you like nothing until you started to believe it who raped you and told you it was your fault and whose daddy was a cop so who would believe you anyway Come on women You know this man I can name the ones in my past name yours and imagine each as president with every woman s life in his care Would you even trust him to watch your dog That s a trick question because he would never do it His defining characteristic is that he does not care about you When Mr Trump tells Mr Bush that he s gotta use a Tic Tac just in case he cannot restrain himself from non consensually affixing his perfectly round gasping lamprey mouth over Ms Zucker s he is talking about sexually assaulting a co worker When he says he grabs women s genitals he is talking about sexually assaulting anyone he feels like at any time Female Trump voters It s fine if you ve come to terms with not being a full human being in the eyes of your party but what about your daughters Is that the life you want for

while his followers persist in howling that sexism is a feminist myth While Mr Trump boasts about sexual assault and vows to suppress disobedient media cable news pundits spend their time taking a protractor to Mrs Clinton s smile a constant churning microanalysis of nothing Many people well many men are expressing their disgust with Mr Trump the only way they know how By invoking their mothers and daughters and sisters people presumably with the anatomy Mr Trump feels free to assess and knead Hillary Clinton has been showing us all year and all her life that sure women can be cherished if

of progressive men too for that matter don t understand Most of you are no better than Mr Trump you are just more subtle If you have spent your career brutalizing and dehumanizing women legislatively rather than personally you are no better If you were happy to overlook months of violent racism xenophobia transphobia and Islamophobia from the Trump campaign but now you re mad that he used a bad word and tried to sleep with another man s wife you are no better If you have derided and stigmatized identity politics in an effort to keep the marginalized from organizing you are no better If you

	{ "text": "I like authenticity especially as compared to survey tested or heavily spun I am prepared to let a candidate say something that I don t completely agree with and still support him or her I think the need to be politically correct has gone too far I also think the media often hypes and slants stories to the point of being untruthful I think a prosperous middle class is the key to the American success story both economically and politically and that lobbyists have way too much sway I am very much a pragmatist so much so that I like compromise more than I like ideology I like deals especially those that are win win So Donald Trump is my candidate right He is NOT In when I was years old and he was Donald Trump hired me to be his attorney on a major northern New Jersey project a shopping center which like everything else was to bear his name Trump Centre It was a big deal that he picked me and a high honor for me just a couple of years after I started my law firm which is now over years old This was at a time when Trump still built things having recently finished Trump Tower I ll never forget when my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me He seemed to me smart business savvy decisive He had a very impressive office a fancy and very big boat an airline a helicopter shuttle and several casinos Within a few years virtually all of this would be lost because of bad business decisions Lots of lawyers have worked for Donald Trump lots and lots I am no Roy Cohn neither as aggressive nor hopefully nearly as ethically challenged but I did know well how to get very tough land use matters through an always challenging application process in New Jersey I was thrilled when he hired me After the initial interview my client contact with Donald was actually not very much One low point I do remember actually will never forget is a limousine ride to a meeting with the editorial board of a New Jersey newspaper in which my married client sought to regale me with the number and quality of eligible young women who in his words want me I was just plain shocked and embarrassed but I kept smiling I wanted and needed this client happy While I was working for Donald various press reports had Trump and his then wife Ivanna living in a personal apartment in the Trump Tower of and even or rooms Genuinely curious I once asked him how many rooms the apartment actually had I will never forget his response to me However many they will print Donald Trump was then as he is now larger than life particularly in his own eyes and at the same time frighteningly small with very little moral grounding He was then and still is all ego and show I once asked him how many rooms his apartment actually had I will never forget his response to me However many they will print I have thought about this a lot and I want to share my humble insights of why we cannot elect Donald Trump as president of the United States To me it is more about character than politics Because of lack of the former the latter the actual politics of Donald Trump are not that easy to discern Once I got going with my reasons why Donald would not be good for our country it was hard to stop I did stop however when I hit about words from here Read on if you are interested The man lies all the time Like the skilled liar he is he does it with impunity I watched in Jersey City NJ when thousands and thousands of people were cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed The last quarter the gross domestic product was less than zero The number of illegal immigrants in the United States is million it could be million The Mexican government forces bad people into our country The unemployment rate may be as high as percent All these things have been said by Donald actually often yelled by him and many times over and over in front of large crowds How about the whopper Crime statistics show blacks kill percent of white homicide victims One has to wonder why this lie would be conceived much less told Donald Trump says all of these things forcefully so they must be true But they are not Unambiguously they are what is described as pants on fire untruthful as in not a shred of truth In passing you have to ponder whether yet another of Donald Trump s oft made statements about the fervor of his Christianity and the Bible being his favorite book are also not grounded in truth Clearly thou shall not lie is not his favorite of the Ten Commandments It is actually not all about the candidate It s amazing how often I am right I alone can fix this I have a big brain I advise myself I am very very rich Donald really said all these things His ego seems to know no bounds When Donald feels insulted by someone he obsesses without control He fusses he fumes and he says unbelievably inappropriate things He is in his glory when he can bully his way to a result he covets His ego seems to know no bounds When Donald feels insulted by someone he obsesses without control Did you ever notice that those real people stories other candidates are always telling about someone they just met struggling with a difficult problem are just not in the Trump lexicon He keeps telling us he is all about winners I guess these folks don t qualify Said another way Donald Trump doesn t play well in the sandbox with others First he has his own ideas as to who can be in the sandbox with him He also wants to run the sandbox He is the kid who gets his way or stomps off in a huff What happens when he figures out even our nation s highest office is not all about him Do we want him with the codes to nuclear weapons U S presidents are by design not kings The Constitution makes them share power Donald Trump who uses the I word more than anyone who has ever aspired to the job has a brazenly authoritarian bent He wants to be a strongman not a president One has to wonder what would happen if he actually had to govern or make one of his deals in a zero sum world of politics where the other side just says no What then of his notoriously short attention span temper or non stop need to tweet his every frustration The devil IS in the details JONATHAN DRAKE REUTERS Donald Trump holds a sign supporting his plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico that he borrowed from a member of the audience at his campaign rally in Fayetteville North Carolina March Winning so much we will get tired of winning Make good deals with China or even Make America great again are slogans that don t actually say anything We are not stupid share some details with us so we can figure out whether you know what you are talking about For Donald however in the few instances when specifics do follow like perhaps the mile foot wall or the deportation of million immigrants the details never come Never are we told that to build the wall even to the lower feet by actual construction estimates would cost billion dollars even if you could get the land to build it most of the border Trump wants to wall is in the middle of a river and land in many cases could not even be secured for a fence His magic to make Mexico pay for it The only suggestion I have heard is take it out of remittances from folks mailing money back home or one of his percent tariffs How is that going to work for the Americans sending the money to relatives or all of us paying percent more for Mexican made merchandise or the American company doing the manufacturing How about the fact that the wall would do little to stop illegal immigration more of which is overstays of visitors than over the border and likely will generate few if any jobs for the folks Trump has whipped up into a xenophobic frenzy Then let s take the deportation and just focus on the big stuff How exactly do you round up and deport million people Is he going to use stadiums and nationalize cruise ship lines Who will be doing the rounding up certainly not the police the army perhaps The children left behind How about the fact that American farms restaurants not to mention landscaping and construction labor jobs will go unattended Vital jobs for sure but are these the jobs that Trump plans to provide for his real Americans to make America great again Words matter Everything is not a disaster stupid or a disgrace Neither is it tremendous huge fantastic or amazing Everyone is not a loser low energy or a bimbo Talk of former presidents being liars or his favorite a disaster and foreign dictators being great leaders does not advance the discourse Americans are mostly not prudes but vulgarity from the dais penis size allusions reveling in sexual conquests menstruation based criticism and crass insults of every shape and form just does not cut it from a president We have children Reading is good So is studying Donald Trump recently told us that he does not read much We know from the recent revelations by Tony Schwartz his ghost writer on The Art of the Deal yes I do have my copy from when it first came out autographed with Donald telling me to keep up the great work which Donald says is second only to the Bible as the must read book that he certainly has not written a book at least not that one It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job Even though for many years I owned a bookstore and would not let my kids watch TV on weekdays to help them become readers I do not believe you must read to lead I do believe however that those who seek to lead us need to study hard seek to gain wisdom from others and try to master very complex ideas and relationships I think being president is hard I am glad that after a long day President Obama retreats to his private study almost every night for or hours of quiet study and reading Any fair interpretation of Trump s many bizarre statements and flip flops makes it clear he has not the slightest inclination to read or study In his own words he makes decisions with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I already had plus the words common sense because I have lots of common sense and I have a lot of business ability It is a special and unique form of arrogance to think you could even consider being literally the leader of the free world without doing the work to deeply understand the job The new vocabulary we are adjusting to is not a good one Xenophobe intense dislike or fear of people from foreign countries misogynist strong prejudice against women nativist preference for established inhabitants as opposed to immigrants fascist authoritarian and dictatorial bigot intolerance for those with a different opinion demagogue inflaming passions based on popular desires not on rationale arguments dystopian describing a place typically totalitarian where everything is unpleasant and squalid racist oh you know what this one is We have all had to get the dictionary out to understand many of the not household terms that had to find their way into print to describe the unique phenomenon that is Donald Trump The scary thing is that these strange words are at least close to the mark What happened to statesmanlike well qualified or even brilliant as words we can use to describe people we want to elect to high office Haven t heard any of these associated with the Donald We need to be careful with tough Donald Trump said of a protester at one of his rallies in the good old days they would have carried him out on a stretcher His world reveres this brand of toughness This toughness is not about the strength it takes to use restraint or to make really hard decisions It is about punching that guy in the face or at a minimum saving face his I will resist the temptation to belabor the nuclear codes point again and rather just query do we really want a thin skinned president who as he suggested if a government leader Castro was not on the tarmac to meet his plane would turn around Air Force One and come home Or one who when confronted with the fact that whether or not his careless re tweet of a white supremacist created Jewish star and dollar bill backed attack of Hillary Clinton was anti Semitic can t even just give one of those non apology apologies I am sorry if I offended anyone A tough guy who instead declares major newscasters stupid and sick and makes it all about the media who dare to criticize him with never a word to David Duke and the ugly element high fiving him and resending his initial offensive post Whether or not the post was intended to even more firmly entrench this segment of support Trump demonstrates his version of tough one that glorifies his opinion and his being right over all else Nowhere in his world can tough be humble respectful restrained or diplomatic Success does matter Donald Trump s business success is greatly exaggerated and his skills limited Donald Trump is a great salesman and a showman promoter in a league only with PT Barnum This we can give him He has also been very good at making his name a brand and selling its use For a while he had some pretty high TV ratings by telling out of work celebrities they were fired However even in his own playing field ask any large New York real estate developer of which surprise surprise he is not one at least not as to large th in New York City on the latest list and you will learn his successes are few Four business bankruptcies and the Plaza Hotel Trump Air all three casinos a couple times the steaks the water Trump Centre in New Jersey that I worked on Manhattan s West Side rail yards where buildings do bear his name as a consolation the much hyped get rich scheme Trump University all failures by any measure except of course to Donald who has no regrets whatsoever Then there are basic business ethics lawsuits the fact that he has penchant for not paying bills fully or on time or that he calls himself the King of Debt a king made rich by running up debt then renegotiating it Is this the skill set we want for the president Even with Trump s fabled net worth always exaggerated by billions more than others calculate one has to wonder if his true net worth wouldn t be just as much if he took his considerable inheritance from father Fred and just passively invested it We ll never know from Donald certainly not from those tax returns he won t release We could not be the great country we are without the First Amendment but our media may kill us The media is not Donald s enemy as he keeps announcing from the stage It may be the enemy of the rest of us however It sure feels like it lately The air time Donald gets and his ability to phone in his rants especially with the cable media is nothing short of to use one of his words disgusting Donald who lives by polls and ratings understands it is ratings and not news worthiness that dictates what is on the airwaves Donald dominates almost every news cycle simply by being more outrageous than anyone or anything else The false equivalency created by point counterpoint talking heads then makes over the top positions seem legitimate It is reality TV writ large and it is very out of control Temperament demeanor and character are important In many ways Donald represents the very worst in all of us or at least many of us He is all about continuous gratification He is the petulant child who wants his way He is the selfish teenager with no big picture yet He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race and religion education good looks and family fortune to succeed easily and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not He is the spoiled young man of privilege with the right race and family fortune to succeed easily and who looks down on others lacking in any of the above who do not He is a man who thinks it is okay to call someone fat or ugly or stupid or to make fun of a person with a disability He is the collector of trophy wives and trophy properties the guy who wins or so he thinks because he has the most toys The emperor and his clothes Donald says he knows more about the military than anyone else Why Because he went to an expensive prep school where they wore uniforms and sometimes marched How about I know more about ISIS than the generals Please can some real soldiers evaluate this Donald says America never wins anymore Compared to whom and at what No doubt we have problems Democracy is messy Witness the present campaign and the long slow recovery from the recession has not included the middle class nearly enough And yes trade in a world that is now fully connected and integrated is hard to figure out But by what measure is America as Donald tells us a disaster How do you actually say and believe This country is a hell hole We are going down fast Compared to whom Mexico China or his most bizarre new favorite Russia that he tells us beat us all the time because our leaders are stupid Give us a break Sophomoric speech tricks don t work at least not with most of us Says Donald I am not going to talk about the libertarian VP candidate s alcoholism I refuse to say I cannot stand to say that I cannot stand the sound of Clinton screaming into the microphone all the time You just did Donald We get it that with these statements even you know you are on shaky ground so you are trying to play it both ways Doesn t work Nor does your even more insidious not so clever trick of attributing to others wild accusations that even you are afraid to make but that you want to advance How about when discussing the Orlando massacre there are a lot of people that think President Obama doesn t want to get it A lot of people think maybe he doesn t want to know about it I happen to think he just doesn t know what he is doing but there are many people that think maybe he just doesn t want to get it He doesn t want to see what s really happening And that could be Who are these people who have placed the president on the side of the terrorists Perhaps the same people who with Trump saw the masses in New Jersey celebrating the destruction of the twin towers or those convinced Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster that Ted Cruz s father was working with Lee Harvey Oswald to kill President Kennedy or that President Obama was not born in the United States nor did he graduate from Harvard or Columbia Two possibilities The likely one lots of people are saying is just Trump code for I want to now float something so outrageous even red faced Donald can t get it out without this qualifier Or perhaps the lots of people is a select group the closed loop of the loyalists who attend his rallies that heard it from him A thin skin does not work for a president The politicians have again chosen this presidential pigmy as their nominee So said the long defunct New York Herald about Abraham Lincoln now nearly everybody s choice for our nation s best president Consider the statement when George Washington left office the time is now arrived for the source of all misfortune of our country to be reduced to a level with his fellow citizens U S presidents all of them have had their critics and in our land of wonderful free speech the critics get to have their say Thank goodness That Donald does not do well with criticism is not really open to debate Ask Megyn Kelly third rate talent Rosie O Donnell nice little fat Rosie total loser or Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas or for that matter virtually any of his recently vanquished adversaries Cruz Kasich Rubio or Bush in just the first tier Even the one most like him now apparently looking for a post New Jersey job with him Chris Christie felt his sting when he suggested Donald was thin skinned He just can t let anything go ever He obsesses even when he wins Republicans who broke the pledge to support him they should not be allowed to run for office again In Donald s world disagreeing with him has to have a consequence a serious one and pursuing this goal is worthy of effort and energy even when it makes no difference Do we really think our president has time for this Do we really want a man with such sensibilities and such an authoritarian bent in charge of say the FBI or the IRS Does the concept of secret police a favorite of leaders of this type elsewhere seem too extreme Probably yes But if I was Donald I would float it with one of his people are saying declarations There I just used his trick See how easy it is Bullies will always exist somewhere but the White House should not be that somewhere What does a bully do Most of all he or she seeks to intimidate physically or at least verbally So far this character trait of Donald s has been exclusively verbal and aimed at business adversaries and more recently politicians and journalists and of course then ex ghost writer of his book and ex employees or contractors he cheated those who do not have anti disparagement contractual handcuffs who dare to candidly assess his conduct What happens when this guy gets the world s strongest army at his disposal and a bully pulpit that guarantees him notice Seem like a bad idea to anyone else Law and order Before it was an Emmy winning TV show law and order was a campaign theme used by Richard Nixon in to get himself elected in a year when our country had two very public assassinations and destructive demonstrations even riots in U S cities Nixon sought to mobilize what he called the silent majority around the need for more police He also tapped into the racial and economic divide between black and white and working class and elite Eastern liberals and the evil media that his vice president Spiro Agnew called nattering nabobs of negativism Is Donald Trump seeking to bring this back Of course yes yet no Yes he wants to separate and mobilize angry voters who feel left behind by an increasingly diverse culture No because his dystopian version of lawless besieged pitifully weak America is not what Nixon preached nor for that matter Ronald Reagan It is unique to him at least in our country It is however a textbook version of the rallying cry of countless dictators and strongmen It is a demagogue s basic tool to gin up a problem then declare he is the only one who can fix it As bad as all this rhetoric is what next He tells us On January the day I take the oath of office Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon I mean very soon come to an end How s this work Donald Martial law Does he honestly believe President Obama and for that matter all of his predecessors would not have liked to have all laws effective and fully followed If only wishing could make it so However since the states not the federal government hold sway over most criminal law the president acting alone has no Constitutional power to do any such thing What then More of the water boarding and killing families of terrorists logic I alone can fix it Incoherent rants often contradictory does not a foreign policy make Convince Japan and South Korea to seek nuclear arms Eliminate NATO Crush ISIS but do it without Muslim allies and no troops on the ground Sometimes attack Libya sometimes not Sometimes attack surgically but don t let it come out the way it did Sometimes it s good we attacked Iraq sometimes not Do not nation build but fix Syria Stop Iran by making better deals In fact come to think of it that is the solution to almost everything just make better deals everywhere Oh yes and never apologize for anything We are America very very rich and beholden to no one Like us or else Sound like someone we know How will anyone effectively be president if we don t at least respect the office In the s during an unpopular war we all endured a president adorning himself with a flag pin and declaring anyone who did not agree with him which include a heck of a lot of young people on campuses all across America including me somehow un American Although political opposition is as old as our nation we begin to slide down the slope of dangerous disrespect when disagreement is replaced with vilification This Republican nominee for the presidency thinks it is okay to accuse a former president of his own party of intentionally going to war on false pretenses and the current President of being in conspiracy with Muslim terrorists Any thoughtful American of either party or no party of any political philosophy must see that this must stop Truth or at least a semblance of some has to come back Outrageous lies just have no place in meaningful discourse outrageous liars even less so They cannot become the backbone of a point counterpoint talking head media circus that is so much more about ratings than truth Rich and powerful guys have to play by the rules too Let s not kid ourselves Trump University was not an academic institution far from it It was a get rich quick scheme by a guy selling a get rich quick scheme It is not the first or the last of its type Late night cheap advertising time television will always feature this fare Donald s efforts however were on so much a grander scale a university Really What this was is an out and out fraud scheme by a man now trying to become the leader of our country and the free world We all know or at least have read that suckers are born every minute But can t we at least disrespect those who prey on these poor folks and when they really go too far sue them No says Donald Trump The court case brought by a whole class of plaintiffs against his scam is only still in court Donald says because the long time and distinguished federal judge is a hater not capable of giving him justice because his parents are from Mexico In Donald s world the only individual capable of judging him would not be Mexican or related to anyone from Mexico likewise folks of the Muslim faith and oh yeah likewise women In this world rich entitled egotistical ethically challenged older white men should then only be judged by rich entitled egotistical ethically challenged older white men We must stand for something Donald Trump s version of America does not include folks not like him Instead he is all about what Sarah Palin labeled real Americans The fact that all us others seem to be utterly expendable is deeply troubling Targeting an entire religion Islam with billion adherents million being U S citizens for extra scrutiny or worse is patently inconsistent with traditional American values if not those of the real Americans It is also unconstitutional and beyond all this incredibly counterproductive as it hardens the lines of controversy by wholesale moving of the allies we need to solve terrorist problems into the enemy camp Other similar strategies championed by Donald like waterboarding and other forms of torture not to mention targeting families of an enemy are not just illegal They are to use another one of his words stupid They do not work very likely making situations worse and our enemies more numerous and passionate One has to wonder what does the America of the real Americans look like A bunch of intolerant hyper aggressive folks behind a big wall isolated not trading with anyone and thus with a sick economy and very expensive goods and with a lot of enemies No Shining City on the Hill for sure Hard to see anything but ruin ahead for such a place We can do so much better For me

	{ "text": "Don t expect to see Donald Trump give a humble concession speech if he loses the Republican presidential nomination During a Sunday rally in Maryland the Republican presidential frontrunner mocked candidates who praise their opponents during concession speeches saying that if he loses the contest Americans will probably not hear much from him again They fight like hell for six months and they re saying horrible things the worst things you can imagine Trump said And then one of them loses one of them wins And the one who loses says I just want to congratulate my opponent He is a brilliant man he ll be a great governor or president or whatever He continued I m not sure you re ever going to see me there I don t think I m going to lose but if I do I don t think you re ever going to see me again folks I think I ll go to Turnberry and play golf or something Trump s mockery wasn t relegated just to the electoral losers He also said Sunday that the winners were too modest Half the times the winners put them in the administration that s how they get rid of them Trump said of the losing candidates This line of thought has not stopped Trump from graciously accepting endorsements from other candidates who have dropped out of the presidential race Trump frequently touts his support from Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson During a news conference in February announcing Christie s endorsement Trump lauded Christie s tenure as a governor and his barbs during the Republican presidential debates Generally speaking I m not big on endorsements Trump said adding This was an endorsement that really meant a lot ", "label": "pos"},
	{ "text": "DONALD J TRUMP until now a Republican problem this week became a challenge the nation must confront and overcome The real estate tycoon is uniquely unqualified to serve as president in experience and temperament He is mounting a campaign of snarl and sneer not substance To the extent he has views they are wrong in their diagnosis of America s problems and dangerous in their proposed solutions Mr Trump s politics of denigration and division could strain the bonds that have held a diverse nation together His contempt for constitutional norms might reveal the nation s two century old experiment in checks and balances to be more fragile than we knew Any one of these characteristics would be disqualifying together they make Mr Trump a peril We recognize that this is not the usual moment to make such a statement In an ordinary election year we would acknowledge the Republican nominee move on to the Democratic convention and spend the following months like other voters evaluating the candidates performance in debates on the stump and in position papers This year we will follow the campaign as always offering honest views on all the candidates But we cannot salute the Republican nominee or pretend that we might endorse him this fall A Trump presidency would be dangerous for the nation and the world Why are we so sure Start with experience It has been years since a major party nominated anyone for president who did not have electoral experience That experiment turned out pretty well but Mr Trump to put it mildly is no Dwight David Eisenhower Leading the Allied campaign to liberate Europe from the Nazis required strategic and political skills of the first order and Eisenhower though he liked to emphasize his common touch as he faced the intellectual Democrat Adlai Stevenson was shrewd diligent humble and thoughtful In contrast there is nothing on Mr Trump s r sum to suggest he could function successfully in Washington He was staked in the family business by a well to do father and has pursued a career marked by some real estate successes some failures and repeated episodes of saving his own hide while harming people who trusted him Given his continuing refusal to release his tax returns breaking with a long bipartisan tradition it is only reasonable to assume there are aspects of his record even more discreditable than what we know The lack of experience might be overcome if Mr Trump saw it as a handicap worth overcoming But he displays no curiosity reads no books and appears to believe he needs no advice In fact what makes Mr Trump so unusual is his combination of extreme neediness and unbridled arrogance He is desperate for affirmation but contemptuous of other views He also is contemptuous of fact Throughout the campaign he has unspooled one lie after another that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated after that his tax cut plan would not worsen the deficit that he opposed the Iraq War before it started and when confronted with contrary evidence he simply repeats the lie It is impossible to know whether he convinces himself of his own untruths or knows that he is wrong and does not care It is also difficult to know which trait would be more frightening in a commander in chief Given his ignorance it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Trump offers no coherence when it comes to policy In years past he supported immigration reform gun control and legal abortion as candidate he became a hard line opponent of all three Even in the course of the campaign he has flip flopped on issues such as whether Muslims should be banned from entering the United States and whether women who have abortions should be punished Worse than the flip flops is the absence of any substance in his agenda Existing trade deals are stupid but Mr Trump does not say how they could be improved The Islamic State must be destroyed but the candidate offers no strategy for doing so Eleven million undocumented immigrants must be deported but Mr Trump does not tell us how he would accomplish this legally or practically What the candidate does offer is a series of prejudices and gut feelings most of them erroneous Allies are taking advantage of the United States Immigrants are committing crimes and stealing jobs Muslims hate America In fact Japan and South Korea are major contributors to an alliance that has preserved a peace of enormous benefit to Americans Immigrants commit fewer crimes than native born Americans and take jobs that no one else will Muslims are the primary victims of Islamist terrorism and Muslim Americans including thousands who have served in the military are as patriotic as anyone else Fareed Zakaria America would be Trump s banana republic The Trump litany of victimization has resonated with many Americans whose economic prospects have stagnated They deserve a serious champion and the challenges of inequality and slow wage growth deserve a serious response But Mr Trump has nothing positive to offer only scapegoats and dark conspiracy theories He launched his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists across the border and similar hatefulness has surfaced numerous times in the year since In a dangerous world Mr Trump speaks blithely of abandoning NATO encouraging more nations to obtain nuclear weapons and cozying up to dictators who in fact wish the United States nothing but harm For eight years Republicans have criticized President Obama for apologizing for America and for weakening alliances Now they put forward a candidate who mimics the vilest propaganda of authoritarian adversaries about how terrible the United States is and how unfit it is to lecture others He has made clear that he would drop allies without a second thought The consequences to global security could be disastrous Most alarming is Mr Trump s contempt for the Constitution and the unwritten democratic norms upon which our system depends He doesn t know what is in the nation s founding document When asked by a member of Congress about Article I which enumerates congressional powers the candidate responded I am going to abide by the Constitution whether it s number number number number The charter has seven articles Worse he doesn t seem to care about its limitations on executive power He has threatened that those who criticize him will suffer when he is president He has vowed to torture suspected terrorists and bomb their innocent relatives no matter the illegality of either act He has vowed to constrict the independent press He went after a judge whose rulings angered him exacerbating his contempt for the independence of the judiciary by insisting that the judge should be disqualified because of his Mexican heritage Mr Trump has encouraged and celebrated violence at his rallies The U S democratic system is strong and has proved resilient when it has been tested before We have faith in it But to elect Mr Trump would be to knowingly subject it to threat Mr Trump campaigns by insult and denigration insinuation and wild accusation Ted Cruz s father was involved in the assassination of President John F Kennedy Hillary Clinton may be guilty of murder Mr Obama is a traitor who wants Muslims to attack The Republican Party has moved the lunatic fringe onto center stage with discourse that renders impossible the kind of substantive debate upon which any civil democracy depends Most responsible Republican leaders know all this to be true that is why Mr Trump had to rely so heavily on testimonials by relatives and employees during this week s Republican convention With one exception Bob Dole the living Republican presidents and presidential nominees of the past three decades all stayed away But most current officeholders even those who declared Mr Trump to be an unthinkable choice only months ago have lost the courage to speak out The party s failure of judgment leaves the nation s future where it belongs in the hands of voters Many Americans do not like either candidate this year We have criticized the presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the past and will do so again when warranted But we do not believe that she or the Libertarian and Green party candidates for that matter represents a threat to the Constitution Mr Trump is a unique and present danger ", "label": "pos"},

	{ "text": "This is my last column until after the election so I d like to address the people least likely to read it Donald Trump voters Who knows Maybe I ll get lucky and a few of them will buy fish wrapped in this column and they ll accidentally peruse it Desperate times call for desperate measures While I ve opposed the Trump candidacy from the start I ve never disparaged Trump voters Some are friends and neighbors they re all fellow Americans We should take their concerns seriously But we should also demand that they be serious that they draw distinctions between these two presidential candidates Yes Hillary Clinton is a flawed leader but in the way so many presidents were We know her flaws She has a weakness for secrecy occasionally fudges truths has fawning aides and a husband who lacks discipline when it comes to moneymaking and women But she is not indecent and that is an important distinction And she s studious has sought out people of substance on every issue and has taken the job of running for president seriously Trump is not only a flawed politician he s an indecent human being He s boasted of assaulting women prompting to come forward to testify that he did just that to them his defense is that he could not have assaulted these women because they weren t pretty enough He s created a university that was charged with defrauding its students He s been charged with discriminating against racial minorities in his rental properties He s stiffed countless vendors from piano sellers to major contractors He s refused to disclose his tax returns because they likely reveal that he s paid no federal taxes for years is in bed with dodgy financiers and doesn t give like he says to charity He s compared the sacrifice of parents of a soldier killed in Iraq to his sacrifice of building tall buildings He s vowed if elected to prosecute his campaign rival We have never seen such behaviors in a presidential candidate At the same time Trump has shown no ability to talk about any policy issue with any depth Harlan Coben s debate night tweet last month had it right On Aleppo he sounds like a fifth grader giving a book report on a book he never read I understand why many Trump supporters have lost faith in Washington and want to just shake things up When you shake things up with a studied plan and a clear idea of where you want to get to you can open new futures But when you shake things up guided by one liners and no moral compass you can cause enormous instability and systemic vertigo Receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times s products and services PRIVACY POLICY But there is an even more important reason Trump supporters particularly less educated white males should be wary of his bluster His policies won t help them Trump promises to bring their jobs back But most of their jobs didn t go to a Mexican They went to a microchip The idea that large numbers of manual factory jobs can be returned to America if we put up a wall with Mexico or renegotiate our trade deals is a fantasy Trump ignores the fact that manufacturing is still by far the largest sector of the U S economy Indeed our factories now produce twice what they did in but with one third fewer workers Trump can t change that Machines and software will keep devouring and spawning more work of all kinds Did you hear that IBM s cognitive computer Watson helped to create a pop song Not Easy with the Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid The song was released on Oct IBM noted and within hours it climbed to No on iTunes s Hot Tracks No one knows for certain how we deal with this new race with and against machines but I can assure you it s not Trump s way build walls restrict trade give huge tax cuts to the rich The best jobs in the future are going to be what I call STEMpathy jobs jobs that blend STEM skills science technology engineering math with human empathy We don t know what many of them will look like yet The smartest thing we can do now is to keep our economy as open and flexible as possible to get the change signals first and be able to quickly adapt create the opportunity for every American to engage in lifelong learning because whatever jobs emerge will require more knowledge make sure that learning stresses as much of the humanities and human interactive skills as hard sciences make sure we have an immigration policy that continues to attract the world s most imaginative risk takers and strengthen our safety nets because this era will leave more people behind This is the only true path to American greatness in the st century Trump wants to make America great in ways that are just not available anymore What do we have to lose by trying his way Trump asks The answer is everything that actually makes us great When the world gets this fast small errors in navigation have huge consequences While Clinton has failed to inspire her instincts and ideas will keep us hewing to basically the right course And however great her flaws she is still in the zone of human decency Trump is not We can never be great as a country with a president with the warped values of Donald Trump I pray that

	{ "text": "Tonight Donald J Trump accepted the Republican Party s nomination for president of the United States And I am for the first time since I began covering American politics genuinely afraid Donald Trump is not a man who should be president This is not an ideological judgment This is not something I would say about Mitt Romney or Marco Rubio This is not a disagreement over Donald Trump s tax plan or his climate policies This is about Trump s character his temperament his impulsiveness his basic decency Back in February I wrote that Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament he s a racist a sexist and a demagogue but he s also a narcissist a bully and a dilettante He lies so constantly and so fluently that it s hard to know if he even realizes he s lying He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash He has had plenty of time to prove me and everyone else wrong But he hasn t He has not become more responsible or more sober more decent or more generous more considered or more informed more careful or more kind He has continued to retweet white supremacists make racist comments pick unnecessary fights contradict himself on the stump and show an almost gleeful disinterest in building a real campaign or learning about policy He has instead run a campaign based on stoking fear and playing to resentment His speech tonight invoked a nightmarish American hellscape that doesn t actually exist His promise to restore order made him sound like the aspiring strongman his critics fear him to be I have a message for all of you the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end he said Beginning on January th safety will be restored Here is what we know truly know about Trump Here is why he should not be president Trump is vindictive So far the unifying theme of Trump s convention is that the leader of the opposition party should be thrown in jail Trump didn t like the Washington Post s coverage of his campaign so he barred its reporters from his rallies and threatened to use the power of the presidency to bring an antitrust suit against the Post s owner Jeff Bezos He was upset that Ohio didn t vote for him so he sat its delegation in the cheap seats even though the state is hosting the convention He was angry about an interview his ex ghostwriter gave to the New Yorker so he sent his lawyers after him He hates the protesters who interrupt his campaigns so he said he would look into paying the legal fees of a supporter who sucker punched one of them Imagine Donald Trump with the powers of the presidency Imagine what he could do what he would do to those who crossed him Trump is a bigot Donald Trump kicked off his campaign calling Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists He responded to Ted Cruz s surge in Iowa by calling for a ban on Muslim travel He sought to discredit a US born judge by saying his rulings were suspect because of his Mexican heritage Trump s campaign is certainly the first time in my memory that a sitting speaker of the House has had to describe something his party s nominee said as the textbook definition of a racist comment This is not a man who should be put in charge of an increasingly diverse country that needs to find allies in an increasingly diverse world Trump is a sexist Stories of Trump s casual sexism abound but during the campaign it was women who questioned him who felt the full force of his misogyny The first Republican debate for instance was hosted by Fox News and moderated by Megyn Kelly Bret Baier and Chris Wallace Kelly wasn t obviously tougher on Trump than her colleagues but she was the antagonist he focused on retweeting a follower who said she was a bimbo and saying she had blood coming out of her wherever After Carly Fiorina challenged him in a debate Trump said to Rolling Stone Look at that face Would anyone vote for that Can you imagine that the face of our next president After Hillary Clinton needed to take a bathroom break during a debate Trump told the crowd It s too disgusting Don t say it it s disgusting It s not just during political campaigns that this side of Trump emerges Trump once told his friend Philip Johnson that the secret to women was y ou have to treat em like shit Trump is a liar Trump boasts constantly that he had the judgment and foresight to oppose the Iraq War But he didn t On September Trump was asked by Howard Stern whether he supported the invasion of Iraq Yeah I guess so he replied Trump has not sought to explain these comments or offer evidence of an alternative judgment he offered elsewhere He just lies about this and he does so often But that s true for Trump across many issues He says his health care plan will insure everyone when it will do nothing of the kind He says his tax plan raises taxes on the wealthy when it actually cuts them sharply Trump has lied about his net worth his reasons for not releasing his tax returns and his charitable donations He lies easily fluently shamelessly constantly Trump is a narcissist Trump s towering self regard worked for him as a real estate developer His real business was licensing his name out for building menswear golf courses steaks A bit of a narcissism is necessary to become a global brand But the trait is maladaptive in a presidential candidate The most recent example was the minutes he spent talking about himself when he was supposed to be introducing Mike Pence his vice presidential candidate for the first time The most grotesque example was when he responded to the deadliest mass shooting in American history by tweeting Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism Trump admires authoritarian dictators for their authoritarianism When MSNBC s Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin who kills journalists political opponents and invades countries Trump replied He s running his country and at least he s a leader unlike what we have in this country But it s not just Putin Trump has praised Saddam Hussein because he killed terrorists He did that so good They didn t read them the rights He said you ve got to give Kim Jong Un credit He goes in he takes over and he s the boss It s incredible It s not just that Trump admires these authoritarians it s that the thing he admires about them is their authoritarianism their ability to dispense with niceties like a free press due process and political opposition Trump is a conspiracy theorist Trump burst onto the scene as a leader of the absurd birther movement He s said that Bill Ayers is the real author of Barack Obama s Dreams From My Father explained that the unemployment rate in America is really over percent and suggested that both Antonin Scalia and Vince Foster were murdered Trump is very very gullible This is related to his conspiracy theories but Trump has a habit of believing and retweeting bad information that sounds good to him at the time This has led to among other things Trump retweeting false crime statistics Trump retweeting Mussolini quotes from a Twitter account called Il Duce Trump promoting a fake video claiming a protester who rushed his stage was sent by ISIS and Trump endorsing a National Enquirer report suggesting Ted Cruz s dad helped kill JFK When pressed about these sundry embarrassments Trump said All I know is what s on the internet That s a reasonable response from your uncle who forwards you weird email chains but not from a presidential candidate Trump doesn t apologize and his defensiveness escalates situations On Monday night it became very clear that Melania Trump s convention speech had lifted two paragraphs from Michelle Obama s convention speech The error was an embarrassment but it could have been dispatched quickly by simply admitting fault and apologizing Instead the Trump campaign turned it into a multi day story and a character issue by denying anything had happened and blaming Hillary Clinton This is an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton how she seeks out to demean her and take her down said campaign chair Paul Manafort in one of the most genuinely ridiculous comments in recent American history The campaign also tried to argue that Michelle Obama doesn t own the English language and that similar language was used by Twilight Sparkle a My Little Pony I m serious Finally days later the Trump campaign admitted there was plagiarism and blamed a miscommunication between Melania and her speechwriter A similar pattern played out when Trump tweeted an anti Hillary meme that superimposed a Star of David atop a pile of money and accused Clinton of corruption The image was obviously anti Semitic and the Trump campaign quickly took it down But Trump himself went on a Twitter rampage arguing that what was clearly a Star of David was actually just a sheriff s star or maybe just a regular old star and that the campaign shouldn t have removed the offending meme in the first place So far these examples are farce but as Tim Lee writes this tendency in the Oval Office could lead to tragedy Trump s behavior on the campaign trail suggests that he would be unlikely to admit mistakes and defuse tense situations Instead his first instinct would be to escalate every conflict in an effort to bully foreign adversaries into giving him his way That might work in some cases But in others especially against powerful countries like China or Russia the results could be disastrous Trump surrounds himself with sycophants It s tradition for presidential candidates to release a note from their physician testifying to their fitness to fulfill the duties of the presidency On December Donald Trump submitted his entry to this quadrennial custom If elected Mr Trump I can state unequivocally will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency Dr Harold Bornstein writes His blood pressure and laboratory test results were astonishingly excellent His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary This is not how most doctor notes read Reached for comment regarding this a spokesperson at the American Medical Association just giggled reported the Daily Beast There are many positions where one might accept a pliable crony But personal physician should not be one of them The fact that Trump would entrust his health to a doctor who would sign off on a note like this should terrify his family and friends But more than that it should disqualify him from the presidency Trump has proven too lazy to learn about policy Trump didn t know much about policy when the campaign started and as far as anyone can tell he hasn t made any obvious effort to rectify that The latest and most damaging example is his interview with the New York Times in which he said he would not automatically defend NATO countries against attack from Russia It s not obvious Trump meant to say that or even knew what saying that meant as Manafort immediately began denying Trump had ever said it The Times subsequently released a transcript showing that yes Trump had said it But this is a pattern for Trump who doesn t bother to come up with convincing answers even to obvious questions and definitely has not put in the time to develop a deep understanding of the issues he might face as president As Matt Yglesias wrote this is very much a choice Trump has made Trump is now the GOP nominee and there are hundreds of professional Republican Party politicians and operatives around the country who would gladly help him become a sharper better informed candidate It doesn t happen because he can t be bothered Trump has run an incompetent campaign and convention As brilliant as Trump has been in securing media attention for himself and channeling the anxieties of conservative voters he hasn t bothered to build a real campaign organization and his convention has been a festival of unforced errors This is the context of Melania Trump s plagiarism of Ted Cruz s anti endorsement of the night that was supposed to be about jobs and the economy but was actually about Benghazi and jailing Hillary Clinton In isolation these are gaffes mistakes bad luck Together though they tell a damning story of organizational incompetence The most generous interpretation of this is that Trump is capable of running an effective organization but he s just not interested in conventions and field operations in the way he is interested in golf courses and condos Others have certainly testified to the trouble Trump has focusing on tasks that don t engage him His former ghostwriter says He has no attention span Unfortunately the president actually needs to focus on all kinds of dull and unpleasant tasks Trump is a bully Trump won the Republican nomination by proving that even adults can be bullied with schoolyard taunts There was low energy Jeb and Little Marco and Lyin Ted and now we ve got Crooked Hillary Trump made fun of Rand Paul s looks and Chris Christie s weight and Carly Fiorina s face and a New York Times reporter s physical disability It seems like this shouldn t have to be said but it s better to be kind than cruel and there s a deep instinctual cruelty in Trump he finds people s weak spots their insecurities and he exposes them in front of crowds Trump has regularly incited or justified violence among his supporters At a rally in St Louis Donald Trump lamented that nobody wants to hurt each other anymore Yes lamented The topic was protesters and Trump s frustration was clear They re being politically correct the way they take them out he sighed Protesters they realize there are no consequences to protesting anymore There used to be consequences There are none anymore Earlier in the campaign two of Trump s supporters attacked a homeless Mexican man and told the police Donald Trump was right all these illegals need to be deported Trump s response I will say that people who are following me are very passionate They love this country and they want this country to be great again The simple fact of it is that Donald Trump should not be president of the United States That is not because he is too conservative as some Democrats would have it or because he is not conservative enough as many Republicans would have it It s because the presidency is a powerful job where mistakes can kill millions and whoever holds it needs to take that power seriously and wield it responsibly Trump has had ample opportunity to demonstrate his sense of seriousness and responsibility He has failed It is said that the benefit of America s long presidential campaigns is they offer the candidates time to show us who they really are Trump has shown us who he really is He is a person who should not be president That he is being brought this close to the presidency that he is one major mistake by Hillary Clinton away from winning it should scare us all It certainly scares me ", "label": "pos"},

that appeared to be pertinent to the investigation that was suspended in July which had looked into Clinton s use of a private server Multiple federal sources told NBC News that the emails were found as a part of an ongoing probe into Weiner s alleged illicit communication with an underage girl PlayPete Williams FBI found nothing new in review Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Pete Williams FBI found nothing new in review On the Clinton campaign s plane spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said she was glad to see that Comey had affirmed the conclusion reached in July and that the matter is resolved The Trump campaign didn t immediately respond to NBC News request for comment On Twitter former House Speaker Newt Gingrich a Trump surrogate started the campaign s pivot back to the rigged system claims they shared earlier in the election season Related Fact Checking Everything Trump and Clinton Said About the FBI s Email Review A senior law enforcement official confirmed to NBC News that nearly all of the thousands of newly examined emails on Weiner s laptop were duplicates of emails already seen by the team investigating Clinton s server Although some emails did forward documents previously identified as containing classified information the review didn t change the total number of classified documents investigators found on the server There were unseen emails the official said but they were unrelated to government business The new letter indicates that the FBI s review is completed Neither Comey nor the FBI are expected to release any other statements Democrats and Republicans had starkly different reactions although both sides indicated that beyond Clinton s vindication the FBI still had much to resolve In the days that come we will have many questions about the FBI s handling of this investigation said John Conyers Jr of Michigan ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee In the meantime however I welcome this news confirming again that no charges are warranted in this matter Republicans quickly countered Secretary Clinton s use of a private email server including to transmit classified information was extremely careless and a dereliction of duty said Ron Johnson of Wisconsin chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee There are also several open questions about the FBI s examination of these facts ", "label":

least trips aboard the Lolita Express even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights according to records obtained by FoxNews com Clinton s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein s Boeing on occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between and included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including Tatiana The tricked out jet earned its Nabakov inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls Bill Clinton associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein who everyone in New York certainly within his inner circles knew was a pedophile said Conchita Sarnoff of the Washington D C based non profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking and author of a book on the Epstein case called TrafficKing Why would a former president associate with a man like that Virginia Roberts who claims she was pimped out by Epstein at age has previously claimed she saw Clinton at Epstein s getaway in but logs do not show Clinton aboard any flights to St Thomas the nearest airport capable of accommodating Epstein s plane They do show Clinton flying aboard Epstein s plane to such destinations as Hong Kong Japan Singapore China Brunei London New York the Azores Belgium Norway Russia and Africa Among those regularly traveling with Clinton were Epstein s associates New York socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein s assistant Sarah Kellen both of whom were investigated by the FBI and Palm Beach Police for recruiting girls for Epstein and his friends In response to a separate FOIA request from FoxNews com the U S Secret Service said it has no records showing agents were ever on the island with Clinton A Clinton spokesperson did not return emails requesting comment about the former president s relationship and travels with Epstein The Clinton Library said it had no relevant information and does not keep track of Clinton s travel records Martin Weinberg Epstein s current attorney did not respond to multiple inquiries Epstein said in a court filing said that he and his associates have been the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks allegations and plain inventions Police in Palm Beach Fla launched a year long investigation in into Epstein after parents of a year old girl said their daughter was sexually abused by him Police interviewed dozens of witnesses confiscated his trash performed surveillance and searched his Palm Beach mansion ultimately identifying girls between the ages of and who they said were sexually abused by Epstein In at the request of Palm Beach Police the FBI launched a federal probe into allegations that Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of and to engage in illegal sexual activities According to court documents police investigators found a clear indication that Epstein s staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of and years old literally every day often two or three times per day One victim in sworn deposition testimony said Epstein began sexually assaulting her when she was years old and molested her on more than occasions over the next three years The girls testified they were lured to Epstein s home after being promised hundreds of dollars to be his model or masseuse but when they arrived he ordered them to take off their clothes and massage his naked body while he masturbated and used sex toys on them The U S Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse witness tampering and money laundering but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up On Sept in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency Epstein agreed to a month sentence including months of jail time and months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse In exchange the U S Attorney s Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co conspirators Florida attorney Brad Edwards who represented some of Epstein s alleged victims is suing the federal government over the secret non prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims to prevent them from voicing any objection and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically connected billionaire and all of his co conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls The U S Attorney for the Southern District of Florida did not respond to a request for comment about the deal Other politicians celebrities and businessmen including presidential candidate Donald Trump have been accused of fraternizing with Epstein Trump lawyer Alan Garten told FoxNews com in a statement Trump and

	{ "text": "It seems we re entering another of those stupid seasons humans impose on themselves at fairly regular intervals My background is archaeology so also history and anthropology It leads me to look at big historical patterns My theory is that most peoples perspective of history is limited to the experience communicated by their parents and grandparents so years To go beyond that you have to read study and learn to untangle the propaganda that is inevitable in all telling of history In a nutshell at university I would fail a paper if I didn t compare at least two if not three opposing views on a topic Taking one telling of events as gospel doesn t wash in the comparative analytical method of research that forms the core of British academia I can t speak for other systems but they re definitely not all alike in this way So zooming out we humans have a habit of going into phases of mass destruction generally self imposed to some extent or another This handy list shows all the wars over time Wars are actually the norm for humans but every now and then something big comes along I am interested in the Black Death which devastated Europe The opening of Boccaccio s Decameron describes Florence in the grips of the Plague It is as beyond imagination as the Somme Hiroshima or the Holocaust I mean you quite literally can t put yourself there and imagine what it was like For those in the midst of the Plague it must have felt like the end of the world Trump is a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger creating a cult around himself But a defining feature of humans is their resilience To us now it seems obvious that we survived the Plague but to people at the time it must have seemed incredible that their society continued afterwards Indeed many takes on the effects of the Black Death are that it had a positive impact in the long term Well summed up here By targeting frail people of all ages and killing them by the hundreds of thousands within an extremely short period of time the Black Death might have represented a strong force of natural selection and removed the weakest individuals on a very broad scale within Europe In addition the Black Death significantly changed the social structure of some European regions Tragic depopulation created the shortage of working people This shortage caused wages to rise Products prices fell too Consequently standards of living increased For instance people started to consume more food of higher quality But for the people living through it as with the World Wars Soviet Famines Holocaust it must have felt inconceivable that humans could rise up from it The collapse of the Roman Empire Black Death Spanish Inquisition Thirty Years War War of the Roses English Civil War it s a long list Events of massive destruction from which humanity recovered and move on often in better shape At a local level in time people think things are fine then things rapidly spiral out of control until they become unstoppable and we wreak massive destruction on ourselves For the people living in the midst of this it is hard to see happening and hard to understand To historians later it all makes sense and we see clearly how one thing led to another During the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme I was struck that it was a direct outcome of the assassination of an Austrian Arch Duke in Bosnia I very much doubt anyone at the time thought the killing of a minor European royal would lead to the death of million people My point is that this is a cycle It happens again and again but as most people only have a year historical perspective they don t see that it s happening again As the events that led to the First World War unfolded there were a few brilliant minds who started to warn that something big was wrong that the web of treaties across Europe could lead to a war but they were dismissed as hysterical mad or fools as is always the way and as people who worry about Putin Brexit and Trump are dismissed now A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if you d listened and thought a bit Then after the War to end all Wars we went and had another one Again for a historian it was quite predictable Lead people to feel they have lost control of their country and destiny people look for scapegoats a charismatic leader captures the popular mood and singles out that scapegoat He talks in rhetoric that has no detail and drums up anger and hatred Soon the masses start to move as one without any logic driving their actions and the whole becomes unstoppable That was Hitler but it was also Mussolini Stalin Putin Mugabe and so many more Mugabe is a very good case in point He whipped up national anger and hatred towards the land owning white minority who happened to know how to run farms and seized their land to redistribute to the people in a great populist move which in the end unravelled the economy and farming industry and left the people in possession of land but starving See also the famines created by the Soviet Union and the one caused by the Chinese Communists last century in which million people died It seems inconceivable that people could create a situation in which tens of millions of people die without reason but we do it again and again But at the time people don t realize they re embarking on a route that will lead to a destruction period They think they re right they re cheered on by jeering angry mobs their critics are mocked This cycle the one we saw for example from the Treaty of Versaille to the rise of Hitler to the Second World War appears to be happening again But as with before most people cannot see it because They are only looking at the present not the past or future They are only looking immediately around them not at how events connect globally Most people don t read think challenge or hear opposing views Trump is doing this in America Those of us with some oversight from history can see it happening Read this brilliant long essay in the New York magazine to understand how Plato described all this and it is happening just as he predicted Trump says he will Make America Great Again when in fact America is currently great according to pretty well any statistics He is using passion anger and rhetoric in the same way all his predecessors did a charismatic narcissist who feeds on the crowd to become ever stronger creating a cult around himself You can blame society politicians the media for America getting to the point that it s ready for Trump but the bigger historical picture is that history generally plays out the same way each time someone like him becomes the boss On a wider stage zoom out some more Russia is a dictatorship with a charismatic leader using fear and passion to establish a cult around himself Turkey is now there too Hungary Poland Slovakia are heading that way and across Europe more Trumps and Putins are waiting in the wings in fact funded by Putin waiting for the popular tide to turn their way We should be asking ourselves what our Archduke Ferdinand moment will be How will an apparently small event trigger another period of massive destruction We see Brexit Trump Putin in isolation The world does not work that way all things are connected and affecting each other I have pro Brexit friends who say Oh you re going to blame that on Brexit too But they don t realize that actually yes historians will trace neat lines from apparently unrelated events back to major political and social shifts like Brexit We are entering a bad phase It will be unpleasant for those living through it maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination Brexit a group of angry people winning a fight easily inspires other groups of angry people to start a similar fight empowered with the idea that they may win That alone can trigger chain reactions A nuclear explosion is not caused by one atom splitting but by the impact of the first atom that splits causing multiple other atoms near it to split and they in turn causing multiple atoms to split The exponential increase in atoms splitting and their combined energy is the bomb That is how World War One started and ironically how World War Two ended An example of how Brexit could lead to a nuclear war could be this Brexit in the UK causes Italy or France to have a similar referendum Le Pen wins an election in France Europe now has a fractured EU The EU for all its many awful faults has prevented a war in Europe for longer than ever before The EU is also a major force in suppressing Putin s military ambitions European sanctions on Russia really hit the economy and helped temper Russia s attacks on Ukraine there is a reason bad guys always want a weaker European Union Trump wins in the US Trump becomes isolationist which weakens NATO He has already said he would not automatically honor NATO commitments in the face of a Russian attack on the Baltics With a fractured EU and weakened NATO Putin facing an ongoing economic and social crisis in Russia needs another foreign distraction around which to rally his people He funds far right anti EU activists in Latvia who then create a reason for an uprising of the Russian Latvians in the East of the country the EU border with Russia Russia sends peace keeping forces and aid lorries into Latvia as it did in Georgia and in Ukraine He cedes Eastern Latvia as he did Eastern Ukraine Crimea has the same population as Latvia by the way A divided Europe with the leaders of France Hungary Poland Slovakia and others now pro Russia anti EU and funded by Putin overrule calls for sanctions or a military response NATO is slow to respond Trump does not want America to be involved and a large part of Europe is indifferent or blocking any action Russia seeing no real resistance to their actions move further into Latvia and then into Eastern Estonia and Lithuania The Baltic States declare war on Russia and start to retaliate as they have now been invaded so have no choice Half of Europe sides with them a few countries remain neutral and a few side with Russia Where does Turkey stand on this How does ISIS respond to a new war in Europe Who uses a nuclear weapon first This is just one Arch Duke Ferdinand scenario The number of possible scenarios are infinite due to the massive complexity of the many moving parts And of course many of them lead to nothing happening But based on history we are due another period of destruction and based on history all the indicators are that we are entering one It will come in ways we can t see coming and will spin out of control so fast people won t be able to stop it Historians will look back and make sense of it all and wonder how we could all have been so na ve How could I sit in a nice caf in London writing this without wanting to run away How could people read it and make sarcastic and dismissive comments about how pro Remain people should stop whining and how we shouldn t blame everything on Brexit Others will read this and sneer at me for saying America is in great shape that Trump is a possible future Hitler and yes Godwin s Law But my comparison is to another narcissistic charismatic leader fanning flames of hatred until things spiral out of control It s easy to jump to conclusions that oppose pessimistic predictions based on the weight of history and learning Trump won against the other Republicans in debates by countering their claims by calling them names and dismissing them It s an easy route but the wrong one Ignoring and mocking the experts as people are doing around Brexit and Trump s campaign is no different to ignoring a doctor who tells you to stop smoking and then finding later you ve developed incurable cancer A little thing leads to an unstoppable destruction that could have been prevented if you d listened and thought a bit But people smoke and people die from it That is the way of the human We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups try to cross the ever widening social divides So I feel it s all inevitable I don t know what it will be but we are entering a bad phase It will be unpleasant for those living through it maybe even will unravel into being hellish and beyond imagination Humans will come out the other side recover and move on The human race will be fine changed maybe better But for those at the sharp end for the thousands of Turkish teachers who just got fired for the Turkish journalists and lawyers in prison for the Russian dissidents in gulags for people lying wounded in French hospitals after terrorist attacks for those yet to fall this will be their Somme What can we do Well again looking back probably not much The liberal intellectuals are always in the minority See Clay Shirky s Twitter Storm on this point The people who see that open societies being nice to other people not being racist not fighting wars is a better way to live they generally end up losing these fights They don t fight dirty They are terrible at appealing to the populace They are less violent so end up in prisons camps and graves We need to beware not to become divided see Labour party we need to avoid getting lost in arguing through facts and logic and counter the populist messages of passion and anger with our own similar messages We need to understand and use social media We need to harness a different fear Fear of another World War nearly stopped World War but didn t We need to avoid our own echo chambers Trump and Putin supporters don t read the Guardian so writing there is just reassuring our friends We need to find a way to bridge from our closed groups to other closed groups try to cross the ever widening social divides Perhaps I m just writing this so I can be remembered by history as one of the people who saw it coming ", "label": "pos"},

promising to continue the political revolution in a town hall on Thursday giving a glimpse into his possible future role in the Democratic Party in which he campaigns for progressive candidates across the country Speaking with the cadence and conviction of a viable candidate in midtown Manhattan Sanders again did not concede the nomination and did not endorse his opponent Here s the video of Bernie

calls to end Bernie s campaign Vermont s Senator is taking his political revolution to Philadelphia and he ll continue to run for the presidency Why would he stop Would you end your presidential campaign if your opponent faced on ongoing FBI criminal investigation Bernie Sanders his campaign and millions of supporters throughout the nation and world must wait until July th knowing that the FBI will likely disclose its findings of Clinton s email investigation before the Democratic convention POLITICO confirmed the other day that Clinton s email investigation is a criminal investigation as stated by Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan Judge links Clinton aide s immunity to criminal investigation A former information technology aide to Hillary Clinton received immunity from the Justice Department in connection with a criminal investigation a federal judge confirmed Tuesday Bryan Pagliano a computer expert who worked at the State Department while Clinton was secretary of state and was also paid privately by her was previously reported to have received immunity in connection with statements he gave to the FBI about Clinton s private server set up However there had been no explicit confirmation that the investigation which Clinton has repeatedly referred to as a security review is actually a criminal probe The privacy interests at stake are high because the government s criminal investigation through which Mr Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential U S District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan wrote in an order issued Tuesday When a U S District Court Judge confirms your opponent faces a criminal investigation there s no reason to concede or leave a race for the presidency Furthermore Judge Sullivan clearly stated The privacy interests at stake are high because the government s criminal investigation through which Mr Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential Clinton s security review days are over especially since the White House also confirmed the criminal investigation But there s no chance of Clinton facing legal consequences right If you know the answer to this question then tell the world next year s winner of the Super Bowl Also explain how Clinton circumvents repercussions from the following NBC article titled Hillary Clinton Emails Held Info Beyond Top Secret Emails from Hillary Clinton s home server contained information classified at levels higher than previously known including a level meant to protect some of the most sensitive U S intelligence according to a document obtained by NBC News In a letter to lawmakers the intelligence community s internal watchdog says some of Clinton s emails contained information classified Top Secret Special Access Program a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held U S intelligence matters Two American intelligence officials tell NBC News these are not the same two emails from Clinton s server that have long been reported as containing information deemed Top Secret While she was secretary of state from to Clinton conducted government business over private email The arrangement was particularly unusual because the email system relied not on Yahoo or Google but her own server which she kept in her home in Westchester County N Y The act of transferring Special Access Program intelligence from secure government networks onto an unsecure private server correlates directly to the Espionage Act I explain why Clinton s Special Access Program intelligence will lead to a Bernie Sanders presidency in the following YouTube segment Finally nothing proves both election fraud and a Bernie Sanders presidency better than Clinton s treatment of donors As stated by CNN last week Secretary of State Clinton put a Chicago commodities trader on an advisory board regarding nuclear strategy Washington CNN A major political donor to the Clintons and other top Democrats was selected by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to serve on a key State Department intelligence board in despite having no clear background in the area according to emails released this week In July Fernando was appointed to a seat on the International Security Advisory Board ISAB a panel filled with top level foreign policy advisers and security experts Former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart chairs the current panel which includes retired generals the former chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other high ranking national security experts As a member of the top level group Fernando was granted a Top Secret security clearance and given access to highly sensitive information Fernando professional State Department staff noted seemed an awkward selection for the group and spurred concern when an ABC News reporter inquired about him in An aide Wade Boese replied that night that Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills had added Fernando s name to the list of appointees approved by Clinton The true answer is that S staff Cheryl Mills added him The board s membership preceded me Raj was not on the list sent to S he was added at their insistence Boese wrote S refers to Clinton ABC News reported Not only did this commodities trader have no background in nuclear strategy but he s also a Democratic super delegate Still believe the system didn t favor Clinton From private servers to advisory boards with donors and super delegates Clinton s candidacy is unique in American history I recently challenged Nate Cohn and Harry Enten polling experts who failed to predict the rise of Bernie or Trump on the data pertaining to presidential candidates and FBI criminal investigations I asked if they could crunch the numbers and come up with some kind of analysis on whether or not Clinton will become president based on prior candidates facing FBI criminal probes Something tells me that most observers have conveniently ignored the fact Bernie s challenger risks serious legal consequences One can only imagine what pundits would say about Bernie Sanders if he were in Clinton s position Therefore Bernie has every reason to stay in the race especially since nobody has ever become nominee alongside an FBI criminal probe With Bernie Sanders there s no risk of scandal or FBI investigations The talk of Bernie leaving the race must stop especially since Clinton s emails will dominate the

	{ "text": "Let us now address the greatest American mystery at the moment what motivates the supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump I call it a mystery because the working class white people who make up the bulk of Trump s fan base show up in amazing numbers for the candidate filling stadiums and airport hangars but their views by and large do not appear in our prestige newspapers On their opinion pages these publications take care to represent demographic categories of nearly every kind but blue collar is one they persistently overlook The views of working class people are so foreign to that universe that when New York Times columnist Nick Kristof wanted to engage a Trump supporter last week he made one up along with this imaginary person s responses to his questions When members of the professional class wish to understand the working class Other they traditionally consult experts on the subject And when these authorities are asked to explain the Trump movement they always seem to zero in on one main accusation bigotry Only racism they tell us is capable of powering a movement like Trump s which is blowing through the inherited structure of the Republican party like a tornado through a cluster of McMansions Trump himself provides rather excellent evidence for this finding The man is an insult clown who has systematically gone down the list of American ethnic groups and offended them each in turn He wants to deport millions upon millions of undocumented immigrants He wants to bar Muslims from visiting the United States He admires various foreign strongmen and dictators and has even retweeted a quote from Mussolini This gold plated buffoon has in turn drawn the enthusiastic endorsement of leading racists from across the spectrum of intolerance a gorgeous mosaic of haters each of them quivering excitedly at the prospect of getting a real honest to god bigot in the White House All this stuff is so insane so wildly outrageous that the commentariat has deemed it to be the entirety of the Trump campaign Trump appears to be a racist so racism must be what motivates his armies of followers And so on Saturday New York Times columnist Timothy Egan blamed none other than the people for Trump s racism Donald Trump s supporters know exactly what he stands for hatred of immigrants racial superiority a sneering disregard of the basic civility that binds a society Stories marveling at the stupidity of Trump voters are published nearly every day Articles that accuse Trump s followers of being bigots have appeared by the hundreds if not the thousands Conservatives have written them liberals have written them impartial professionals have written them The headline of a recent Huffington Post column announced bluntly that Trump Won Super Tuesday Because America is Racist A New York Times reporter proved that Trump s followers were bigots by coordinating a map of Trump support with a map of racist Google searches Everyone knows it Trump s followers passions are nothing more than the ignorant blurtings of the white American id driven to madness by the presence of a black man in the White House The Trump movement is a one note phenomenon a vast surge of race hate Its partisans are not only incomprehensible they are not really worth comprehending Or so we re told Last week I decided to watch several hours of Trump speeches for myself I saw the man ramble and boast and threaten and even seem to gloat when protesters were ejected from the arenas in which he spoke I was disgusted by these things as I have been disgusted by Trump for years But I also noticed something surprising In each of the speeches I watched Trump spent a good part of his time talking about an entirely legitimate issue one that could even be called leftwing Yes Donald Trump talked about trade In fact to judge by how much time he spent talking about it trade may be his single biggest concern not white supremacy Not even his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border the issue that first won him political fame He did it again during the debate on March asked about his political excommunication by Mitt Romney he chose to pivot and talk about trade It seems to obsess him the destructive free trade deals our leaders have made the many companies that have moved their production facilities to other lands the phone calls he will make to those companies CEOs in order to threaten them with steep tariffs unless they move back to the US Trump embellished this vision with another favorite leftwing idea under his leadership the government would start competitive bidding in the drug industry We don t competitively bid he marveled another true fact a legendary boondoggle brought to you by the George W Bush administration Trump extended the critique to the military industrial complex describing how the government is forced to buy lousy but expensive airplanes thanks to the power of industry lobbyists Thus did he hint at his curious selling proposition because he is personally so wealthy a fact about which he loves to boast Trump himself is unaffected by business lobbyists and donations And because he is free from the corrupting power of modern campaign finance famous deal maker Trump can make deals on our behalf that are good instead of bad The chance that he will actually do so of course is small He appears to be a hypocrite on this issue as well as so many other things But at least Trump is saying this stuff All this surprised me because for all the articles about Trump I had read in recent months I didn t recall trade coming up very often Trump is supposed to be on a one note crusade for whiteness Could it be that all this trade stuff is a key to understanding the Trump phenomenon Trade is an issue that polarizes Americans by socio economic status To the professional class which encompasses the vast majority of our media figures economists Washington officials and Democratic powerbrokers what they call free trade is something so obviously good and noble it doesn t require explanation or inquiry or even thought Republican and Democratic leaders alike agree on this and no amount of facts can move them from their Econ dream To the remaining or of America trade means something very different There s a video going around on the internet these days that shows a room full of workers at a Carrier air conditioning plant in Indiana being told by an officer of the company that the factory is being moved to Monterrey Mexico and that they re all going to lose their jobs As I watched it I thought of all the arguments over trade that we ve had in this country since the early s all the sweet words from our economists about the scientifically proven benevolence of free trade all the ways in which our newspapers mock people who say that treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement allow companies to move jobs to Mexico Well here is a video of a company moving its jobs to Mexico courtesy of Nafta This is what it looks like The Carrier executive talks in that familiar and highly professional HR language about the need to stay competitive and the extremely price sensitive marketplace A worker shouts Fuck you at the executive The executive asks people to please be quiet so he can share his information His information about all of them losing their jobs Now I have no special reason to doubt the suspicion that Donald Trump is a racist Either he is one or as the comedian John Oliver puts it he is pretending to be one which amounts to the same thing But there is another way to interpret the Trump phenomenon A map of his support may coordinate with racist Google searches but it coordinates even better with deindustrialization and despair with the zones of economic misery that years of Washington s free market consensus have brought the rest of America It is worth noting that Trump is making a point of assailing that Indiana air conditioning company from the video in his speeches What this suggests is that he s telling a tale as much about economic outrage as it is tale of racism on the march Many of Trump s followers are bigots no doubt but many more are probably excited by the prospect of a president who seems to mean it when he denounces our trade agreements and promises to bring the hammer down on the CEO that fired you and wrecked your town unlike Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton Here is the most salient supporting fact when people talk to white working class Trump supporters instead of simply imagining what they might say they find that what most concerns these people is the economy and their place in it I am referring to a study just published by Working America a political action auxiliary of the AFL CIO which interviewed some white working class voters in the suburbs of Cleveland and Pittsburgh in December and January Support for Donald Trump the group found ran strong among these people even among self identified Democrats but not because they are all pining for a racist in the White House Their favorite aspect of Trump was his attitude the blunt and forthright way he talks As far as issues are concerned immigration placed third among the matters such voters care about far behind their number one concern good jobs the economy People are much more frightened than they are bigoted is how the findings were described to me by Karen Nussbaum the executive director of Working America The survey confirmed what we heard all the time people are fed up people are hurting they are very distressed about the fact that their kids don t have a future and that there still hasn t been a recovery from the recession that every family still suffers from it in one way or another Tom Lewandowski the president of the Northeast Indiana Central Labor Council in Fort Wayne puts it even more bluntly when I asked him about working class Trump fans These people aren t racist not any more than anybody else is he says of Trump supporters he knows When Trump talks about trade we think about the Clinton administration first with Nafta and then with Permanent Normal Trade Relations China and here in Northeast Indiana we hemorrhaged jobs They look at that and here s Trump talking about trade in a ham handed way but at least he s representing emotionally We ve had all the political establishment standing behind every trade deal and we endorsed some of these people and then we ve had to fight them to get them to represent us Now let us stop and smell the perversity Left parties the world over were founded to advance the fortunes of working people But our left party in America one of our two monopoly parties chose long ago to turn its back on these people s concerns making itself instead into the tribune of the enlightened professional class a creative class that makes innovative things like derivative securities and smartphone apps The working people that the party used to care about Democrats figured had nowhere else to go in the famous Clinton era expression The party just didn t need to listen to them any longer What Lewandowski and Nussbaum are saying then should be obvious to anyone who s dipped a toe outside the prosperous enclaves on the two coasts Ill considered trade deals and generous bank bailouts and guaranteed profits for insurance companies but no recovery for average people ever these policies have taken their toll As Trump says we have rebuilt China and yet our country is falling apart Our infrastructure is falling apart Our airports are like Third World Trump s words articulate the populist backlash against liberalism that has been building slowly for decades and may very well occupy the White House itself whereupon the entire world will be required to take seriously its demented ideas Yet still we cannot bring ourselves to look the thing in the eyes We cannot admit that we liberals bear some of the blame for its emergence for the frustration of the working class millions for their blighted cities and their downward spiraling lives So much easier to scold them for their twisted racist souls to close our eyes to the obvious reality of which Trumpism is just a crude and ugly expression that neoliberalism has well and truly failed Thomas Frank is the author of Listen Liberal or Whatever Happened to the Party of the People published March by Metropolitan Books This article was amended on March to reflect the fact that Nafta stands for the North American Free Trade Agreement An earlier version of this article referred to it as North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement ", "label": "pos"},

rhetoric has caused even some other Republicans to label him a racist and Romney said he would not be able to paper over his incendiary remarks I don t want to see trickle down racism Romney said in an interview here in a suite overlooking the Wasatch Mountains where he is hosting his yearly ideas conference I don t want to see a president of the United States saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation and trickle down racism trickle down bigotry trickle down misogyny all these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America Romney retreat puts spotlight on Trump s fundraising problem in critical stretch Trump speaking at a rally in Richmond Virginia Friday night didn t address Romney s criticism directly but did say I am the least racist person the least racist person that you ve ever seen a line he frequently says at campaign events By Saturday morning Trump was directly responding to Romney tweeting Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog Now he calls me racist but I am least racist person there is Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog Now he calls me racist but I am least racist person there is He then added Don King and so many other African Americans who know me well and endorsed me would not have done so if they thought I was a racist He kept up his attacks while speaking at a campaign rally on Saturday in Tampa Florida telling the crowd I don t think he knows what a misogynist is Don t forget this guy let us down He would later double down on the criticism at a campaign event in Pittsburgh Romney considering Johnson Romney who actively sought to recruit an independent third party challenger to Trump also conceded that a credible candidate will not emerge But he did show a new openness to one non Trump candidate libertarian Gary Johnson whom he did not rule out voting for Johnson s running mate is another former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld who once fundraised for Romney If the ticket was flipped and Weld was the standard bearer Romney said he would have no qualms about voting for the libertarian ticket this fall Hillary Clinton huddles with top fundraisers If Bill Weld were at the top of the ticket it would be very easy for me to vote for Bill Weld for president Romney said So I ll get to know Gary Johnson better and see if he s someone who I could end up voting for That s something which I ll evaluate over the coming weeks and months Romney s comments on The Situation Room are some of the highest profile support bestowed upon the libertarian ticket which is almost certain to be less funded compared to the GOP and Democratic lines He did however express an uneasiness with Johnson given his position on marijuana legalization Marijuana makes people stupid Romney quipped Johnson said Saturday that others should join Romney in giving the Libertarian nominees a closer look I think Mitt Romney hit it on the head He said Hey I m going to check out Gary Johnson and see what he s got to say he told CNN s Victor Blackwell on CNN Newsroom I think that kind of scrutiny holds up under the light of day The race Obama s legacy congressional gridlock get the most important political news delivered to your inbox By subscribing you agree to our privacy policy Romney once again ruled out running himself but he was also candid about independent efforts to recruit a challenger Several sought after Republicans including Ben Sasse and author David French have taken passes Orrin Hatch explains friendship with Muhammad Ali I think you re not going to find a credible candidate actually running as a third party contender Romney said The only way to win the White House in my view is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people I think the chance to express their own views about Mr Trump or about Secretary Clinton Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson appearing later on The Situation Room dismissed Romney s criticism This again is just sour grapes from the establishment who have had the power stripped out of theirs hands by a candidate that they do not like because he has managed to do something they have been unable to do for decades Pierson said And Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted later Friday Respect Mitt and differences but couldn t disagree more SCOTUS too important to lose for generations Let s stop this and unify Respect Mitt and differences but couldn t disagree more SCOTUS too important to lose for generations Let s stop this and unify In Richmond Trump alluded to his critics though he didn t mention Romney by name Clinton donor received top spot on State Department intel board These poor people going Never Trump never Trump they ve been doing it for months They did it with Indiana they did it with New York We re going to win New York and I won in a massive landslide My choice is different Romney again speculated about what might be in Trump s tax returns which he has repeatedly declined to release claiming that he s under audit Asked what might be in there Romney referred to a months ago comment by Trump that he could not lose support even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City He s calculated that he could get support even if he shot someone but if he released his taxes he d lose support Romney said So there s something in those taxes that s even worse than shooting someone on Fifth Avenue Yet Romney declined to criticize other Republicans who have harbored similar feelings about Trump but endorsed him Romney s mentee and vice presidential running mate Paul Ryan has uneasily backed Trump but Romney declined multiple chances to pass judgment on the speaker s decision Are you disappointed Paul Ryan has endorsed him Blitzer asked I wish everybody in the Republican Party had rejected Mr Trump and chosen someone else Romney said But my choice is different than that of the other people and I m certainly not going to argue with them about their choice Sanders to meet with top supporters to discuss campaign s future Romney also shared some disappointment in the Republican candidates who wooed him fervently for support saying they largely shied away from a fight with Trump in the primary For much of the campaign Republican candidates squabbled to position themselves as the chief Trump alternative I don t think he got the scrutiny applied to him that is typically applied to a front runner by the people running against him he said lamenting that they were firing at each other Jeb Bush had a super PAC of over million And they focused their fire on Marco Rubio and others as opposed to focusing it on the front runner But if Romney had ran Had I been in the race he said I can

	{ "text": " Why Is Clinton disliked Why the hate for Hillary Why do people hate Hillary Clinton so much Is it because of partisanship Or a hard fought primary Maybe NBC once suggested it s because she s not a train wreck Funny how the answers seem to be everything but the obvious We go on endlessly about how untrustworthy she is while fact checkers rank her as the second most honest prominent politician in the country And her opponent as by far the least We say that she has trouble with transparency while her opponent refuses to release his taxes and the current administration sets records for secrecy We decry her ties to corporations and the financial industry while supporting a walking tax shelter or mourning the exit of a president whose re election was funded by a record shattering Wall Street haul We list so very many explanations all of them complete bullshit In truth the Hillary haters seem to resent her more than disagree with her They demand to be humored and catered to They hold her to wildly different standards than her male counterparts They regard her with an unprecedented degree of suspicion Above all they really really want to see her punished And an aggressive male presence even if dangerously incompetent seems to comfort a great many of them Everyone but them knows damn well why Bad news for the haters History is decidedly unafraid of the woman card It doesn t care how many people will stand on tables today and swear they d feel the same if she were a man It will see us for what we are a sick society driven by misogyny and pathetically struggling to come to terms with the fact that women do not exist solely to nurture If that answer isn t as nuanced as the average thinkpiece that s because we as a people are not No matter how many branches have formed they all emerged from the same seed planted way back when Bill Clinton first ran for governor She wouldn t be so suspicious of the press or so measured in her presentation or so any one of a thousand other things if she had been born a man The lengths we go to in order to rationalize this all will be seen in retrospect as extraordinary When the Bush administration was discovered to have erased millions of emails illegally sent by administration officials through private RNC owned accounts in order to thwart an investigation into the politically motivated firing of eight US attorneys just one talk show covered it that Sunday When Mitt Romney wiped servers sold government hard drives to his closest aides and spent in taxpayer money to destroy his administration s emails it was barely an issue When Hillary Clinton asked Colin Powell how he managed to use a Blackberry while serving as Secretary of State he replied by detailing his method of intentionally bypassing federal record keeping laws I didn t have a Blackberry What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line sounds ancient So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department servers I even used it to do business with some foreign leaders and some of the senior folks in the Department on their personal email accounts I did the same thing on the road in hotels There is a real danger If it is public that you have a BlackBerry and it it sic government and you are using it government or not to do business it may become an official record and subject to the law Yet the fact that Hillary Clinton emailed through a private server and didn t use it to cover anything up is somehow the defining issue of her campaign My God people cry anyone else would be in jail Or is the real scandal that her family runs but does not profit from a charitable foundation awarded an A grade by Charity Watch a four out of four star rating by Charity Navigator and responsible for helping million people in countries get things like clean drinking water and HIV medication Because the AP seems super concerned that she encountered people who donated to it specifically Nobel Peace Prize winning economist Muhammad Yunus in her official capacity as Secretary of State It should at this point be observed that her opponent is a shameless con artist who has built an empire bilking people with fake businesses fake universities fake charities and now a fake campaign Last week he told a lie every three minutes and fifteen seconds Oh and did we mention that he like so many of his online supporters is a goddamn Russian stooge I tried to list all of the dumb awful stuff that he does every day and I cannot come close to keeping up Voters it seems are his easiest marks yet And it isn t just Republicans The double standards are even more transparent on the left Back in the mid s Clinton s persistent unwillingness to hide the fact that she was a thinking human female really freaked the center left establishment out Michael Moore observed that Maureen Dowd is fixated on trashing Hillary Rodham in the way liberals love to do to prove they re not really liberal The bashing slowly morphed into a creepy extraordinary sort of policing Since then Clinton racked up a Senate voting record more liberal than any nominee since Mondale Her platform was slightly to Obama s left on domestic issues Her platform was barely to the right of self proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders Yet we have all heard and seen countless liberal posers passionately decrying her far right voting record untrustworthy promises or ever changing policy positions Jon Stewart recently called Clinton a bright woman without the courage of her convictions because I don t know what they even are Because if he doesn t know she must not have any right In fact there is a very lengthy trail of public records all pointing in the same direction If you can t figure out which maybe the problem is you Yet many on the left who gladly voted for John Kerry two years after he voted to authorize the Iraq war now say they couldn t possibly vote for Clinton because she did too And view her with contempt for opposing same sex marriage in while fawning over men like Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders who held the same position at the same time It s time to stop pretending that this is about substance This is about an eagerness to believe that a woman who seeks power will say or do anything to get it This is about a Lady MacBeth stereotype that frankly should never have existed in the first place This is about the one thing no one wants to admit it s about Consider for a moment two people One as a young woman at the beginning of a promising legal career went door to door searching for ways to guarantee an education to the countless disabled and disadvantaged children who had fallen through the cracks The other as a young millionaire exacted revenge on his recently deceased brother s family by cutting off the medical insurance desperately needed by his nephew s newborn son who at eighteen months of age was suffering from violent seizures brought on by a rare neurological disorder What kind of a society treats these two people as equal in any way What kind of society even considers the latter over the former for its highest office Generations from now people will shake their heads at this moment in time when the first female major party presidential nominee competent qualified and more thoroughly vetted than any non incumbent candidate in history endured the humiliation of being likened to such an obvious grifter ignoramus and hate monger We deserve the shame that we will bear ", "label": "pos"},

	{ "text": "Like any number of us raised in the late th century I have spent my life perplexed about exactly how Hitler could have come to power in Germany Watching Donald Trump s rise I now understand Leave aside whether a direct comparison of Trump to Hitler is accurate That is not my point My point rather is about how a demagogic opportunist can exploit a divided country To understand the rise of Hitler and the spread of Nazism I have generally relied on the German Jewish migr philosopher Hannah Arendt and her arguments about the banality of evil Somehow people can understand themselves as just doing their job yet act as cogs in the wheel of a murderous machine Arendt also offered a second answer in a small but powerful book called Men in Dark Times In this book she described all those who thought that Hitler s rise was a terrible thing but chose internal exile or staying invisible and out of the way as their strategy for coping with the situation They knew evil was evil but they too facilitated it by departing from the battlefield out of a sense of hopelessness One can see both of these phenomena unfolding now The first shows itself for instance when journalists cover every crude and cruel thing that comes out of Trump s mouth and thereby help acculturate all of us to what we are hearing Are they not just doing their jobs they will ask in covering the Republican front runner Have we not already been acculturated by years of popular culture to offensive and inciting comments Yes both of these things are true But that doesn t mean journalists ought to be Trump s megaphone Perhaps we should just shut the lights out on offensiveness turn off the mic when someone tries to shout down others reestablish standards for what counts as a worthwhile contribution to the public debate That will seem counter to journalistic norms yes but why not let Trump pay for his own ads when he wants to broadcast foul and incendiary ideas He ll still have plenty of access to freedom of expression It is time to draw a bright line How Donald Trump won the South Carolina GOP primary in seconds Play Video Donald Trump won the Feb South Carolina GOP primary Here s how Peter Stevenson The Washington Post One spots the second experience in any number of water cooler conversations or dinner party dialogues Yes yes it is terrible Can you believe it Have you seen anything like it Has America come to this Agreed agreed But when someone asks what is to be done silence falls Very many of us too many of us are starting to contemplate accepting internal exile Or we joke about moving to Canada more seriously than usually But over the course of the past few months I ve learned something else that goes beyond Arendt s ideas about the banality of evil and feelings of impotence in the face of danger Trump is rising by taking advantage of a divided country The truth is that the vast majority of voting Americans think that Trump is unacceptable as a presidential candidate but we are split by strong partisan ideologies and cannot coordinate a solution to stop him Similarly a significant part of voting Republicans think that Trump is unacceptable but they too thus far have been unable to coordinate a solution Trump is exploiting the fact that we cannot unite across our ideological divides The only way to stop him then is to achieve just that kind of coordination across party lines and across divisions within parties We have reached that moment of truth Republicans you cannot count on the Democrats to stop Trump I believe that Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination and I intend to vote for her but it is also the case that she is a candidate with significant weaknesses as your party knows quite well The result of a head to head contest between Clinton and Trump would be unpredictable Trump has to be blocked in your primary Jeb Bush has done the right thing by dropping out just as he did the right thing by being the first alongside Rand Paul to challenge Trump The time has come John Kasich and Ben Carson to leave the race as well You both express a powerful commitment to the good of your country and to its founding ideals If you care about the future of this republic it is time to endorse Marco Rubio Kasich there s a little wind in your sails but it s not enough Your country is calling you Do the right thing Ted Cruz is I believe pulling votes away from Trump and for that reason is useful in the race But Mr Cruz you are drawing too close to Trump s politics You too should change course Democrats your leading candidate is too weak to count on as a firewall She might be able to pull off a general election victory against Trump but then again she might not Too much is uncertain this year You too need to help the Republicans beat Trump this is no moment for standing by passively If your deadline for changing your party affiliation has not yet come re register and vote for Rubio even if like me you cannot stomach his opposition to marriage equality I too would prefer Kasich as the Republican nominee but pursuing that goal will only make it more likely that Trump takes the nomination The republic cannot afford that Finally to all of you Republicans who have already dropped out one more great act of public service awaits you As candidates you pledged to support whomever the Republican party nominated It s time to revoke your pledge Be bold stand up and shout that you will not support Trump if he is your party s nominee Do it together Hold one big mother of a news conference Endorse Rubio together It is time to draw a bright line and you are the ones on whom this burden falls No one else can do it Marco Rubio this is also your moment to draw a bright line You too ought to rescind your pledge to support the party s nominee if it is Trump Donald Trump has no respect for the basic rights that are the foundation of constitutional democracy nor for the requirements of decency necessary to sustain democratic citizenship Nor can any democracy survive without an expectation that the people require reasonable arguments that bring the truth to light and Trump has nothing but contempt for our intelligence We the people need to find somewhere buried in the recesses of our fading memories the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared

	{ "text": "Some time ago Hillary Clinton and her advisers decided that the best course of action was to apologize for having used a personal email address to conduct government business while serving as secretary of state Clinton herself was clearly not really all that remorseful about this and it showed in her early efforts to address it Eventually aides prevailed upon her to express a greater degree of regret which they hoped would lay the issue to rest It did not Instead email related talk has dogged Clinton throughout the election and it has influenced public perceptions of her in an overwhelmingly negative way July polling showed percent of Americans believed Clinton broke the law by relying on a personal email address with another percent piling on to say the episode showed bad judgments albeit not criminality Because Clinton herself apologized for it and because it does not appear to be in any way important Clinton allies surrogates and co partisans have largely not familiarized themselves with the details of the matter instead saying vaguely that it was an error of judgment and she apologized and America has bigger fish to fry This has had the effect of further inscribing and reinscribing the notion that Clinton did something wrong meaning that every bit of micro news that puts the scandal back on cable amounts to reminding people of something bad that Clinton did In total network newscasts have remarkably dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clinton s emails than to all policy issues combined This is unfortunate because emailgate like so many Clinton pseudo scandals before it is bullshit The real scandal here is the way a story that was at best of modest significance came to dominate the US presidential election overwhelming stories of much more importance giving the American people a completely skewed impression of one of the two nominees and creating space for the FBI to intervene in the election in favor of its apparently preferred candidate in a dangerous way Why Hillary Clinton used a personal email account When Hillary Clinton took office as secretary of state she like most people already had a personal email account Like most people who started a federal job in she was also disheartened to learn that the then current state of federal IT departments was such that she could not connect her personal smartphone to a State Department email address If she wanted ready access to both her email accounts she would need to carry two smartphones As any reporter in Washington knows this indignity was in fact visited upon a huge number of DC denizens for many years Everyone working in government felt that this was kinda bullshit but nobody could really do anything about it Meanwhile Chief Justice John Roberts has opined that carrying two phones could be reasonable grounds to suspect someone is a drug dealer Clinton decided to do something about it Namely she told her top aides to just email her at her personal address so she could keep using whichever devices she wanted This violated an internal State Department policy directive known as a Foreign Affairs Manual which stated that while it was okay to use personal digital devices to do work occasionally normal day to day operations should be conducted on standard State Department equipment Clinton chose to ignore this guideline and because she was the boss nobody could stop her Career foreign service officers and other State personnel have every right to be peeved that Clinton opted out of an annoying policy rather than fixing the underlying issue but it s hardly a matter of overwhelming public concern And indeed it turns out Colin Powell also used a private email address for routine work Condoleezza Rice and Madeleine Albright didn t use email and back before Albright only weird nerds even knew what email was So at the time Clinton took office only one previous secretary of state had ever faced the question of what email account to use and he reached the exact same conclusion Clinton did just use your personal email address Why Hillary used a private email server When Hillary tried the eminently sensible I was following precedent defense Politifact dinged her answer as mostly false on the grounds that while Powell did use a personal email account he didn t use a private email server This distinction has attracted a lot of attention And it s proven politically damaging because while lots of people maintain two email addresses and sometimes do work stuff on their personal email very few Americans use a private email server as opposed to relying on a commercial email service But legally speaking this is completely irrelevant As the State Department inspector general concluded in its report on Clinton s conduct the guideline Clinton violated was a principle that normal day to day operations should be conducted on an authorized Automated Information System Using a private server violates that rule but so would using a Gmail address or simply checking your State gov email address from your personal laptop rather than a Department issue one But while the use of a private server is legally irrelevant it s certainly unusual And it leaves people wondering Why did Clinton go out of her way to set up a private server Clinton as you may have heard is married to former president Bill Clinton who stepped down from office in January of Clinton was in the White House throughout the s when the rest of us were being bombarded with AOL signup CD ROMs so he didn t have a personal email when he left Gmail didn t exist back then and his new job was in effect running a Bill Clinton startup He launched a charitable foundation he established his presidential library and he made big bucks on speaking tours He had a staff and he needed IT infrastructure and support So he paid a guy to set up an email server that he could use Hillary Clinton who is again his wife also set herself up with an account on the same server This is a bit unusual but a lot about being married to a former president is unusual What it s not is suspicious The private server was not a transparency dodge It s become a bit of an article of faith among journalists frustrated with public officials constant FOIA dodging that this is all obviously dissimulation and Clinton was really trying to evade the Freedom of Information Act Many people for example point to the fact that Clinton would routinely travel with multiple digital devices as debunking her supposed convenience argument But this is silly I ve been known to travel with an iPhone an iPad a Kindle and a laptop all at once That doesn t mean needing to carry two separate iPhones one to check my work email and one to check my personal email wouldn t be inconvenient After all what if I was replying to a work email while a text came in to my personal phone and I wanted to check it I d be left juggling phones and looking like an idiot exactly how federal employees tended to look in the heyday of the double fisting phones era I would not want to do that Colin Powell did not want to do that Hillary Clinton did not want to do that Because that would be terrible By contrast it s a terrible solution to a desire to avoid having your emails disclosed to the public via FOIA One way you can tell it s a terrible solution is that Hillary Clinton s work emails have been disclosed to the public You can read them right here The specific timeline is that the House Select Committee on Benghazi requested Clinton s emails in the summer of at which point the relevant State Department personnel realized they did not have the emails because Clinton had been using her personal address State asked Clinton for the emails and she handed them over later that year It was only in March of that the New York Times broke the story of Clinton s personal email account in a scoop by Michael Schmidt the server was reported a few days later by the AP which reported that the emails had been handed over to the State Department two months ago This is fairly clearly not an optimal approach to government record keeping as Thomas Blanton of the National Security Archive at George Washington University told Schmidt at the time It s a shame it didn t take place automatically when she was secretary of state as it should have Someone in the State Department deserves credit for taking the initiative to ask for the records back Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment According to the Inspector General s report Clinton should have preserved any Federal records she created and received on her personal account by printing and filing those records with the related files in the Office of the Secretary There are two possible interpretations here One is that Clinton hatched the private email account plan as an elaborate dodge of federal record keeping laws but then months before the public became aware of the server s existence complied with requests to turn them over The other is that the federal records rule on the book was antiquated and a bit absurd requiring officials to turn over paper copies of emails for no good reason and simply got ignored out of sloppiness But she deleted emails Suspicion at this point is then supposed to focus on the fact that she had her lawyers delete more than emails from her server After Hillary left office the State Department told her she had to turn all her work related emails over to them so she tasked a legal team with determining which emails were work emails and which were not She turned the work emails over because that s what she was legally required to do She deleted the others presumably because she did not want Trey Gowdy and Jason Chaffetz to rummage through her inbox leaking whatever they happened to find amusing to area journalists Now is it possible that Clinton s legal team simply decided to entirely disregard the law and delete work related emails In some sense sure But there s no evidence that this happened Generally speaking in life we assume it would be moderately difficult to hire a well known law firm to destroy evidence for you without someone deciding to do the right thing and squeal Besides which it would be almost comically easy to catch Clinton in the act of systematically destroying relevant emails The vast majority of the work related email correspondence of an incumbent secretary of state after all is going to be correspondence with other government employees Maybe she shoots a note to the Pentagon about Benghazi or circulates ideas for a speech draft with her communications team Any message like that by definition would exist on a government server as well as on her private one This means it would be fully accessible via FOIA and also means that if Clinton s copy were found to not be in the pile of emails she turned over she d be caught red handed The available FOIA workarounds are available to everyone Now what s true is that Clinton could in theory have conducted work related email conversations using another person s personal email address She could for instance have emailed Jake Sullivan on his Gmail address then deleted the email from her private server We d be in the dark and she d get away with it The key thing to note here however is that the availability of this option has nothing to do with Clinton s decision to use a personal account as her exclusive account and also has nothing to do with her decision to host her personal email on a private server At any given time any federal employee can use her personal account to email any other federal employee at his personal account If they receive a Freedom of Information Act request they are legally obligated to hand that correspondence over But in a practical sense if they want to break the law they can probably get away with it And as Ezra Klein has noted there are a lot of workarounds here As every reporter knows when official sources want to tell you something particularly delicate they email you from a personal account or much more often they call A lot of my reporting happens by email But virtually none of my reporting with the White House happens by email There emails for clarification or comment quickly lead to phone calls The reason unsaid but obvious is that phone calls don t leave an official record White House officials can talk freely on the phone in a way they can t over email Similarly the White House keeps a visitor s log If you make an appointment to meet with someone your entrance and point of contact are recorded for posterity and searchable online When someone who shouldn t be meeting with you wants to meet with you they tend to suggest an off site location a restaurant downtown or a nearby coffee shop Peet s Coffee doesn t keep a list of everyone who walks in or out We do not however generally treat all federal employees as having a massive ethical cloud over their heads just because they could probably use this workaround to break the law There is zero reason to apply heightened scrutiny to Clinton just because she also could break the law Besides which when you are secretary of state there is a much simpler and easier way to mask your correspondence classification Here for example is an email Sullivan sent to Clinton on June that was duly handed over to the State Department and made available by the FOIA office I m not saying the contents of that message don t deserve to be redacted for security purposes The fact is that I have no idea But the reality is the American national security state is really really good at using official channels to avoid disclosure of information Nobody needs a private email server to pull that off Indeed the allegation that the server setup was an elaborate con to evade transparency law is doubly ridiculous On the one hand a private server would not be necessary to carry it out All you need is to have a private email address on the side which everyone does While on the other hand the exclusive use of a personal email account means that Clinton s personal account has come under an exceptional level of security The classification thing is a red herring It s precisely because nothing about the basic setup of the email account was in any way wrong that the investigation ended up focusing on the question of mishandling classified information The key point here is that using a State gov email account would not have changed anything When US government officials have conversations about classified matters they are not supposed to use email They are supposed to use special secure channels Nonetheless mistakes happen in part because classification standards are vague and ever changing Technically speaking forwarding a Washington Post article detailing things revealed by Edward Snowden could constitute an improper discussion of classified matters As FBI Director James Comey concluded no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against Clinton over this matter Almost all of the relevant statutes require an intent to mishandle classified information in order to bring a prosecution a standard that Clinton s conduct clearly does not meet Critics have thus chosen to focus on USC a statute that sets a lower gross negligence standard However as Jack Goldsmith one of the top lawyers in George W Bush s administration explains such a prosecution would be entirely novel and would turn in part on very tricky questions about how email exchanges fit into language written with physical removal of classified information in mind Ben Wittes a veteran legal journalist and Brookings fellow who has spent the past several years specializing in national security law wrote that Comey s characterization was clearly correct For the last several months people have been asking me what I thought the chances of an indictment were I have said each time that there is no chance without evidence of bad faith action of some kind People simply don t get indicted for accidental non malicious mishandling of classified material I have followed leak cases for a very long time both at the Washington Post and since starting Lawfare I have never seen a criminal matter proceed without even an allegation of something more than mere mishandling of sensitive information Hillary Clinton is not above the law but to indict her on these facts she d have to be significantly below the law It s true that to a layman the Espionage Act s reference to gross negligence sounds similar to Comey s characterization of Clinton s actions as extremely careless But as Philip Zelikow a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration and currently the Director of the Miller Center at the University of Virginia explains they only sound alike unless you do a tiny bit of homework on the history and caselaw of the Statute Did Hillary Clinton do something criminal with her emails Philip Zelikow walks you through election AnnCompton pastpunditry pic twitter com kS Z dq Qf Miller Center Miller Center November As the Cato Institute s Julian Sanchez writes attempting a prosecution for non malicious mishandling would likely result in the statute being held unconstitutional the Supreme Court s opinion in Gorin v United States which suggests that the Espionage Act s intent requirements are an important feature that save it from unconstitutional vagueness This legal analysis is important because it makes it clear that even if the Weiner laptop emails aren t simply client side copies of the exact emails the FBI already has there is essentially no chance it will change the ultimate verdict The reason Clinton isn t getting locked up is that there was no malign intent Finding another email with classified information on it won t change that conclusion A bullshit scandal amidst a serious election Network newscasts have remarkably dedicated more airtime to coverage of Clinton s emails than to all policy issues combined Cable news has been if anything worse and many prestige outlets have joined the pileup One malign result of obsessive email coverage is that the public is left totally unaware of the policy stakes in the election Another is that the constant vague recitations of the phrase Clinton email scandal have firmly implanted the notion that there is something scandalous about anything involving Hillary Clinton and email including her campaign manager getting hacked or the revelation that one of her aides sometimes checked mail on her husband s computer But none of this is true Clinton broke no laws according to the FBI itself Her setup gave her no power to evade federal transparency laws beyond what anyone who has a personal email account of any kind has Her stated explanation for her conduct is entirely believable fits the facts perfectly and is entirely plausible to anyone who doesn t simply start with the assumption that she s guilty of something Given Powell s conduct Clinton wasn t even breaking with an informal precedent The very worst you can say is that faced with an annoying government IT policy she used her stature to find a personal workaround rather than a systemic fix that would work for everyone To spend so much time on such a trivial matter would be absurd in a city council race much less a presidential election To do so in circumstances when it advances the electoral prospects of a rival who has shattered all precedents in terms of lacking transparency or basic honesty is infinitely more scandalous than anything related to the server itself ", "label": "pos"},
	{ "text": "The American media over the past year has been trying to work out something of a mystery Why is the Republican electorate supporting a far right orange toned populist with no real political experience who espouses extreme and often bizarre views How has Donald Trump seemingly out of nowhere suddenly become so popular What s made Trump s rise even more puzzling is that his support seems to cross demographic lines education income age even religiosity that usually demarcate candidates And whereas most Republican candidates might draw strong support from just one segment of the party base such as Southern evangelicals or coastal moderates Trump currently does surprisingly well from the Gulf Coast of Florida to the towns of upstate New York and he won a resounding victory in the Nevada caucuses Table of contents I What is American authoritarianism II The discovery III How authoritarianism works IV What can authoritarianism explain V The party of authoritarians VI Trump authoritarians and fear VII America s changing social landscape VIII What authoritarians want IX How authoritarians will change American politics Perhaps strangest of all it wasn t just Trump but his supporters who seemed to have come out of nowhere suddenly expressing in large numbers ideas far more extreme than anything that has risen to such popularity in recent memory In South Carolina a CBS News exit poll found that percent of Republican voters supported banning Muslims from the United States A PPP poll found that a third of Trump voters support banning gays and lesbians from the country Twenty percent said Lincoln shouldn t have freed the slaves Last September a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst named Matthew MacWilliams realized that his dissertation research might hold the answer to not just one but all three of these mysteries MacWilliams studies authoritarianism not actual dictators but rather a psychological profile of individual voters that is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders People who score high in authoritarianism when they feel threatened look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear So MacWilliams naturally wondered if authoritarianism might correlate with support for Trump He polled a large sample of likely voters looking for correlations between support for Trump and views that align with authoritarianism What he found was astonishing Not only did authoritarianism correlate but it seemed to predict support for Trump more reliably than virtually any other indicator He later repeated the same poll in South Carolina shortly before the primary there and found the same results which he published in Vox As it turns out MacWilliams wasn t the only one to have this realization Miles away in an office at Vanderbilt University a professor named Marc Hetherington was having his own aha moment He realized that he and a fellow political scientist the University of North Carolina s Jonathan Weiler had essentially predicted Trump s rise back in when they discovered something that would turn out to be far more significant than they then realized That year Hetherington and Weiler published a book about the effects of authoritarianism on American politics Through a series of experiments and careful data analysis they had come to a surprising conclusion Much of the polarization dividing American politics was fueled not just by gerrymandering or money in politics or the other oft cited variables but by an unnoticed but surprisingly large electoral group authoritarians Their book concluded that the GOP by positioning itself as the party of traditional values and law and order had unknowingly attracted what would turn out to be a vast and previously bipartisan population of Americans with authoritarian tendencies This trend had been accelerated in recent years by demographic and economic changes such as immigration which activated authoritarian tendencies leading many Americans to seek out a strongman leader who would preserve a status quo they feel is under threat and impose order on a world they perceive as increasingly alien Trump embodies the classic authoritarian leadership style simple powerful and punitive These Americans with authoritarian views they found were sorting into the GOP driving polarization But they were also creating a divide within the party at first latent between traditional Republican voters and this group whose views were simultaneously less orthodox and often more extreme Over time Hetherington and Weiler had predicted that sorting would become more and more pronounced And so it was all but inevitable that eventually authoritarians would gain enough power within the GOP to make themselves heard At the time even Hetherington and Weiler did not realize the explosive implications that their theory when followed to its natural conclusion predicted a looming and dramatic transformation of American politics But looking back now the ramifications of their research seem disturbingly clear Authoritarians are thought to express much deeper fears than the rest of the electorate to seek the imposition of order where they perceive dangerous change and to desire a strong leader who will defeat those fears with force They would thus seek a candidate who promised these things And the extreme nature of authoritarians fears and of their desire to challenge threats with force would lead them toward a candidate whose temperament was totally unlike anything we usually see in American politics and whose policies went far beyond the acceptable norms A candidate like Donald Trump Donald Trump Scott Olson Getty Images Even Hetherington was shocked to discover quite how right their theory had been In the early fall of as Trump s rise baffled most American journalists and political scientists he called Weiler He asked over and over Can you believe this Can you believe this This winter I got in touch with Hetherington MacWilliams and several other political scientists who study authoritarianism I wanted to better understand the theory that seemed to have predicted with such eerie accuracy Trump s rise And like them I wanted to find out what the rise of authoritarian politics meant for American politics Was Trump just the start of something bigger These political scientists were at that moment beginning to grapple with the same question We agreed there was something important happening here that was just beginning to be understood Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics Shortly after the Iowa Republican caucus in which Trump came in a close second Vox partnered with the Washington based media and polling company Morning Consult to test American authoritarians along a range of political and social views and to test some hypotheses we had developed after speaking with the leading political scientists of the field What we found is a phenomenon that explains with remarkable clarity the rise of Donald Trump but that is also much larger than him shedding new light on some of the biggest political stories of the past decade Trump it turns out is just the symptom The rise of American authoritarianism is transforming the Republican Party and the dynamics of national politics with profound consequences likely to extend well beyond this election I What is American authoritarianism A Trump supporter carries a sign saying Build the wall Andrew Renneisen Getty Images For years now before anyone thought a person like Donald Trump could possibly lead a presidential primary a small but respected niche of academic research has been laboring over a question part political science and part psychology that had captivated political scientists since the rise of the Nazis How do people come to adopt in such large numbers and so rapidly extreme political views that seem to coincide with fear of minorities and with the desire for a strongman leader To answer that question these theorists study what they call authoritarianism not the dictators themselves but rather the psychological profile of people who under the right conditions will desire certain kinds of extreme policies and will seek strongman leaders to implement them The political phenomenon we identify as right wing populism seems to line up with almost astonishing precision with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed After an early period of junk science in the mid th century a more serious group of scholars has addressed this question specifically studying how it plays out in American politics researchers like Hetherington and Weiler Stanley Feldman Karen Stenner and Elizabeth Suhay to name just a few The field after a breakthrough in the early s has come to develop the contours of a grand theory of authoritarianism culminating quite recently in with Stenner s seminal The Authoritarian Dynamic just in time for that theory to seemingly come true more rapidly and in greater force than any of them had imagined in the personage of one Donald Trump and his norm shattering rise According to Stenner s theory there is a certain subset of people who hold latent authoritarian tendencies These tendencies can be triggered or activated by the perception of physical threats or by destabilizing social change leading those individuals to desire policies and leaders that we might more colloquially call authoritarian It is as if the NYU professor Jonathan Haidt has written a button is pushed that says In case of moral threat lock down the borders kick out those who are different and punish those who are morally deviant Authoritarians are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump and will persist as a force in American politics Authoritarians prioritize social order and hierarchies which bring a sense of control to a chaotic world Challenges to that order diversity influx of outsiders breakdown of the old order are experienced as personally threatening because they risk upending the status quo order they equate with basic security This is after all a time of social change in America The country is becoming more diverse which means that many white Americans are confronting race in a way they have never had to before Those changes have been happening for a long time but in recent years they have become more visible and harder to ignore And they are coinciding with economic trends that have squeezed working class white people When they face physical threats or threats to the status quo authoritarians support policies that seem to offer protection against those fears They favor forceful decisive action against things they perceive as threats And they flock to political leaders who they believe will bring this action If you were to read every word these theorists ever wrote on authoritarians and then try to design a hypothetical candidate to match their predictions of what would appeal to authoritarian voters the result would look a lot like Donald Trump But political scientists say this theory explains much more than just Donald Trump placing him within larger trends in American politics polarization the rightward shift of the Republican Party and the rise within that party of a dissident faction challenging GOP orthodoxies and upending American politics More than that authoritarianism reveals the connections between several seemingly disparate stories about American politics And it suggest that a combination of demographic economic and political forces by awakening this authoritarian class of voters that has coalesced around Trump have created what is essentially a new political party within the GOP a phenomenon that broke into public view with the election but will persist long after it has ended II The discovery how a niche subfield of political science suddenly became some of the most relevant research in American politics Buttons for sale on the day of the Iowa caucuses Brendan Hoffman Getty Images Buttons for sale on the day of the Iowa caucuses This study of authoritarianism began shortly after World War II as political scientists and psychologists in the US and Europe tried to figure out how the Nazis had managed to win such wide public support for such an extreme and hateful ideology That was a worthy field of study but the early work wasn t particularly rigorous by today s standards The critical theorist Theodor Adorno for instance developed what he called the F scale which sought to measure fascist tendencies The test wasn t accurate Sophisticated respondents would quickly discover what the right answers were and game the test And there was no proof that the personality type it purportedly measured actually supported fascism More than that this early research seemed to assume that a certain subset of people were inherently evil or dangerous an idea that Hetherington and Weiler say is simplistic and wrong and that they resist in their work They acknowledge the label authoritarians doesn t do much to dispel this but their efforts to replace it with a less pejorative sounding term were unsuccessful If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump s ascent then how else might it be shaping American politics But the real problem for researchers was that even if there really were such a thing as an authoritarian psychological profile how do you measure it How do you interrogate authoritarian tendencies which can sometimes be latent How do you get honest answers on questions that can be sensitive and highly politicized As Hetherington explained to me There are certain things that you just can t ask people directly You can t ask people Do you not like black people You can t ask people if they re bigots For a long time no one had a solution for this and the field of study languished Then in the early s a political scientist named Stanley Feldman changed everything Feldman a professor at SUNY Stonybrook believed authoritarianism could be an important factor in American politics in ways that had nothing to do with fascism but that it could only reliably be measured by unlinking it from specific political preferences He realized that if authoritarianism were a personality profile rather than just a political preference he could get respondents to reveal these tendencies by asking questions about a topic that seemed much less controversial He settled on something so banal it seems almost laughable parenting goals Feldman developed what has since become widely accepted as the definitive measurement of authoritarianism four simple questions that appear to ask about parenting but are in fact designed to reveal how highly the respondent values hierarchy order and conformity over other values Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have independence or respect for elders Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have obedience or self reliance Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have to be considerate or to be well behaved Please tell me which one you think is more important for a child to have curiosity or good manners Feldman s test proved to be very reliable There was now a way to identify people who fit the authoritarian profile by prizing order and conformity for example and desiring the imposition of those values In Feldman convinced the National Election Study a large survey of American voters conducted in each national election year to include his four authoritarianism questions Ever since political scientists who study authoritarianism have accumulated a wealth of data on who exhibits those tendencies and on how they align with everything from demographic profiles to policy preferences What they found was impossible to ignore and is only just beginning to reshape our understanding of the American electorate III How authoritarianism works A Tea Party supporter holds a sign asking Obama where s your papers Justin Sullivan Getty Images A protest against President Obama In the early s as researchers began to make use of the NES data to understand how authoritarianism affected US politics their work revealed three insights that help explain not just the rise of Trump but seemingly a half century of American political dynamics The first was Hetherington and Weiler s insight into partisan polarization In the s the Republican Party had reinvented itself as the party of law order and traditional values a position that naturally appealed to order and tradition focused authoritarians Over the decades that followed authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward the GOP where their concentration gave them more and more influence over time The second was Stenner s theory of activation In an influential book called The Authoritarian Dynamic Stenner argued that many authoritarians might be latent that they might not necessarily support authoritarian leaders or policies until their authoritarianism had been activated The social threat theory helps explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change such as Muslims or same sex couples or Hispanic migrants but rather to reject all of them This activation could come from feeling threatened by social changes such as evolving social norms or increasing diversity or any other change that they believe will profoundly alter the social order they want to protect In response previously more moderate individuals would come to support leaders and policies we might now call Trump esque Other researchers like Hetherington take a slightly different view They believe that authoritarians aren t activated they ve always held their authoritarian preferences but that they only come to express those preferences once they feel threatened by social change or some kind of threat from outsiders But both schools of thought agree on the basic causality of authoritarianism People do not support extreme policies and strongman leaders just out of an affirmative desire for authoritarianism but rather as a response to experiencing certain kinds of threats The third insight came from Hetherington and American University professor Elizabeth Suhay who found that when non authoritarians feel sufficiently scared they also start to behave politically like authoritarians But Hetherington and Suhay found a distinction between physical threats such as terrorism which could lead non authoritarians to behave like authoritarians and more abstract social threats such as eroding social norms or demographic changes which do not have that effect That distinction would turn out to be important but it also meant that in times when many Americans perceived imminent physical threats the population of authoritarians could seem to swell rapidly Together those three insights added up to one terrifying theory that if social change and physical threats coincided at the same time it could awaken a potentially enormous population of American authoritarians who would demand a strongman leader and the extreme policies necessary in their view to meet the rising threats This theory would seem to predict the rise of an American political constituency that looks an awful lot like the support base that has emerged seemingly out of nowhere to propel Donald Trump from sideshow loser of the GOP primary to runaway frontrunner in Beyond being almost alarmingly prescient this theory speaks to an oft stated concern about Trump that what s scariest is not the candidate but rather the extent and fervor of his support And it raises a question If this rise in American authoritarianism is so powerful as to drive Trump s ascent then how else might it be shaping American politics And what effect could it have even after the race has ended IV What can authoritarianism explain Trump greets supporters in Alabama Mark Wallheiser Getty Images In early February shortly after Trump finished second in the Iowa caucus and ended any doubts about his support I began talking to Feldman Hetherington and MacWilliams to try to answer these questions MacWilliams had already demonstrated a link between authoritarianism and support for Trump But we wanted to know how else authoritarianism was playing out in American life from policy positions to party politics to social issues and what it might mean for America s future It was time to call Kyle Dropp Dropp is a political scientist and pollster whom one of my colleagues described as the Doogie Howser of polling He does indeed appear jarringly young for a Dartmouth professor But he is also the co founder of a media and polling company Morning Consult that had worked with Vox on several other projects When we approached Morning Consult Dropp and his colleagues were excited Dropp was familiar with Hetherington s work and the authoritarianism measure he said and was instantly intrigued by how we could test its relevance to the election Hetherington and the other political scientists were in turn eager to more fully explore the theories that had suddenly become much more relevant Non authoritarians who were sufficiently frightened of threats like terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians We put together five sets of questions The first set of course was the test for authoritarianism that Feldman had developed This would allow us to measure how authoritarianism coincided or didn t with our other sets of questions The second set asked standard election season questions on preferred candidates and party affiliation The third set tested voters fears of a series of physical threats ranging from ISIS and Russia to viruses and car accidents The fourth set tested policy preferences in an attempt to see how authoritarianism might lead voters to support particular policies If the research were right then we d expect people who scored highly on authoritarianism to express outsize fear of outsider threats such as ISIS or foreign governments versus other threats We also expected that non authoritarians who expressed high levels of fear would be more likely to support Trump This would speak to physical fears as triggering a kind of authoritarian upsurge which would in turn lead to Trump support We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election The final set of questions was intended to test fear of social change We asked people to rate a series of social changes both actual and hypothetical on a scale of very good to very bad for the country These included same sex marriage a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States and American Muslims building more mosques in US cities If the theory about social change provoking stress amongst authoritarians turned out to be correct then authoritarians would be more likely to rate the changes as bad for the country In the aggregate we were hoping to do a few things We wanted to understand who these people are in simple demographic terms and to test the basic hypotheses about how authoritarianism in theory is supposed to work We wanted to look at the role authoritarians are playing in the election Were they driving certain policy positions for example We wanted to better understand the larger forces that had suddenly made authoritarians so numerous and so extreme was it migration terrorism perhaps the decline of working class whites And maybe most of all we wanted to develop some theories about what the rise of American authoritarianism meant for the future of polarization between the parties as well as a Republican Party that had become both more extreme and internally divided About days later shortly after Trump won the New Hampshire primary the poll went into the field In less than two weeks we had our results V How the GOP became the party of authoritarians Donald Trump and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in Texas Tom Pennington Getty Images Donald Trump and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie sign autographs during a Trump campaign event in Texas The first thing that jumped out from the data on authoritarians is just how many there are Our results found that percent of white respondents nationwide scored as high or very high authoritarians with percent as very high That s actually not unusual and lines up with previous national surveys that found that the authoritarian disposition is far from rare The key thing to understand is that authoritarianism is often latent people in this percent only vote or otherwise act as authoritarians once triggered by some perceived threat physical or social But that latency is part of how over the past few decades authoritarians have quietly become a powerful political constituency without anyone realizing it Today according to our survey authoritarians skew heavily Republican More than percent of people who scored highest on the authoritarianism questions were GOP voters More than percent of surveyed Republicans scored as high or very high authoritarians And at the other end of the scale that pattern reversed People whose scores were most non authoritarian meaning they always chose the non authoritarian parenting answer were almost percent Democrats But this hasn t always been the case According to Hetherington and Weiler s research this is not a story about how Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Venus It s a story of polarization that increased over time They trace the trend to the s when the Republican Party shifted electoral strategies to try to win disaffected Southern Democrats in part by speaking to fears of changing social norms for example the racial hierarchies upset by civil rights The GOP also embraced a law and order platform with a heavily racial appeal to white voters who were concerned about race riots This positioned the GOP as the party of traditional values and social structures a role that it has maintained ever since That promise to stave off social change and if necessary to impose order happened to speak powerfully to voters with authoritarian inclinations Democrats by contrast have positioned themselves as the party of civil rights equality and social progress in other words as the party of social change a position that not only fails to attract but actively repels change averse authoritarians Over the next several decades Hetherington explained to me this led authoritarians to naturally sort themselves into the Republican Party That matters because as more authoritarians sort themselves into the GOP they have more influence over its policies and candidates It is not for nothing that our poll found that more than half of the Republican respondents score as authoritarian Perhaps more importantly the party has less and less ability to ignore authoritarians voting preferences even if those preferences clash with the mainstream party establishment VI Trump authoritarians and fear Based on our data Morning Consult data scientist Adam Petrihos said that among Republicans very high high authoritarianism is very predictive of support for Trump Trump has percent support among Republicans but according to our survey a full percent support among very high authoritarians Authoritarianism was the best single predictor of support for Trump although having a high school education also came close And as Hetherington noted after reviewing our results the relationship between authoritarianism and Trump support remained robust even after controlling for education level and gender Trump support was much lower among Republicans who scored low on authoritarianism only percent But that s still awfully high So what could explain Trump s support among non authoritarians I suspected the answer might lie at least partly in Hetherington and Suhay s research on how fear affects non authoritarian voters so I called them to discuss the data Hetherington crunched some numbers on physical threats and noticed two things The first was that authoritarians tend to fear very specific kinds of physical threats Authoritarians we found in our survey tend to most fear threats that come from abroad such as ISIS or Russia or Iran These are threats the researchers point out to which people can put a face a scary terrorist or an Iranian ayatollah Non authoritarians were much less afraid of those threats For instance percent of very high scoring authoritarians believed that terrorist organizations like ISIS posed a very high risk to them but only percent of very low scoring authoritarians did Domestic threats like car accidents by contrast were much less frightening to authoritarians But Hetherington also noticed something else A subgroup of non authoritarians were very afraid of threats like Iran or ISIS And the more fear of these threats they expressed the more likely they were to support Trump This seemed to confirm his and Suhay s theory that non authoritarians who are sufficiently frightened of physical threats such as terrorism could essentially be scared into acting like authoritarians That s important because for years now Republican politicians and Republican leaning media such as Fox News have been telling viewers nonstop that the world is a terrifying place and that President Obama isn t doing enough to keep Americans safe There are a variety of political and media incentives for why this happens But the point is that as a result Republican voters have been continually exposed to messages warning of physical dangers As the perception of physical threat has risen this fear appears to have led a number of non authoritarians to vote like authoritarians to support Trump An irony of this primary is that the Republican establishment has tried to stop Trump by among other things co opting his message But when establishment candidates such as Marco Rubio try to match Trump s rhetoric on ISIS or on American Muslims they may end up deepening the fear that can only lead voters back to Trump VII Is America s changing social landscape activating authoritarianism But the research on authoritarianism suggests it s not just physical threats driving all this There should be another kind of threat larger slower less obvious but potentially even more powerful pushing authoritarians to these extremes the threat of social change This could come in the form of evolving social norms such as the erosion of traditional gender roles or evolving standards in how to discuss sexual orientation It could come in the form of rising diversity whether that means demographic changes from immigration or merely changes in the colors of the faces on TV Or it could be any changes political or economic that disrupt social hierarchies What these changes have in common is that to authoritarians they threaten to take away the status quo as they know it familiar orderly secure and replace it with something that feels scary because it is different and destabilizing but also sometimes because it upends their own place in society According to the literature authoritarians will seek in response a strong leader who promises to suppress the scary changes if necessary by force and to preserve the status quo This is why in our survey we wanted to study the degree to which authoritarians versus non authoritarians expressed a fear of social change and whether this as expected led them to desire heavy handed responses Our results seemed to confirm this Authoritarians were significantly more likely to rate almost all of the actual and hypothetical social issues we asked about as bad or very bad for the country For instance our results suggested that an astonishing percent of authoritarians believe same sex marriage is harmful to the country Twenty eight percent rated same sex marriage as very bad for America and another percent said that it s bad Only about percent of high scoring authoritarians said same sex marriage was good or very good for the country Tellingly non authoritarians responses skewed in the opposite direction Non authoritarians tended to rate same sex marriage as good or very good for the country The fact that authoritarians and non authoritarians split over something as seemingly personal and nonthreatening as same sex marriage is crucial for understanding how authoritarianism can be triggered by even a social change as minor as expanding marriage rights We also asked respondents to rate whether Muslims building more mosques in American cities was a good thing This was intended to test respondents comfort level with sharing their communities with Muslims an issue that has been particularly contentious this primary election A whopping percent of very high scoring authoritarians said it was either bad or very bad for the country when Muslims built more mosques Only percent of that group said more mosques would be good or very good The literature on authoritarianism suggests this is not just simple Islamophobia but rather reflects a broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened by people they identify as outsiders and by the possibility of changes to the status quo makeup of their communities This would help explain why authoritarians seem so prone to reject not just one specific kind of outsider or social change such as Muslims or same sex couples or Hispanic migrants but rather to reject all of them What these seemingly disparate groups have in common is the perceived threat they pose to the status quo order which authoritarians experience as a threat to themselves And America is at a point when the status quo social order is changing rapidly when several social changes are converging And they are converging especially on working class white people It is conventional wisdom to ascribe the rise of first the Tea Party right and now Trump to the notion that working class white Americans are angry Indeed they are but this data helps explain that they are also under certain demographic and economic pressures that according to this research are highly likely to trigger authoritarianism and thus suggests there is something a little more complex going on than simple anger that helps explain their gravitation toward extreme political responses Working class communities have come under tremendous economic strain since the recession And white people are also facing the loss of the privileged position that they previously were able to take for granted Whites are now projected to become a minority group over the next few decades owing to migration and other factors The president is a black man and nonwhite faces are growing more common in popular culture Nonwhite groups are raising increasingly prominent political demands and often those demands coincide with issues such as policing that also speak to authoritarian concerns Some of these factors might be considered more or less legitimately threatening than others the loss of working class jobs in this country is a real and important issue no matter how one feels about fading white privilege but that is not the point The point rather is that the increasingly important political phenomenon we identify as right wing populism or white working class populism seems to line up with almost astonishing precision with the research on how authoritarianism is both caused and expressed That is not to dismiss white working class concerns as invalid because they might be expressed by authoritarians or through authoritarian politics but rather to better understand why this is happening and why it s having such a profound and extreme effect on American politics Have we misunderstood hard line social conservatism all along Most of the other social threat questions followed a similar pattern On its surface this might seem to suggest that authoritarianism is just a proxy for especially hard line manifestations of social conservatism But when examined more carefully it suggests something more interesting about the nature of social conservatism itself For liberals it may be easy to conclude that opposition to things like same sex marriage immigration and diversity is rooted in bigotry against those groups that it s the manifestation of specific homophobia xenophobia and Islamophobia But the results of the Vox Morning Consult poll along with prior research on authoritarianism suggests there might be something else going on There is no particular reason after all why parenting goals should coincide with animus against specific groups We weren t asking questions about whether it was important for children to respect people of different races but about whether they should respect authority and rules generally So why do they coincide so heavily What might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner s theory of activation What is most likely Hetherington suggested is that authoritarians are much more susceptible to messages that tell them to fear a specific other whether or not they have a preexisting animus against that group Those fears would therefore change over time as events made different groups seem more or less threatening It all depends he said on whether a particular group of people has been made into an outgroup or not whether they had been identified as a dangerous other Since September some media outlets and politicians have painted Muslims as the other and as dangerous to America Authoritarians by nature are more susceptible to these messages and thus more likely to come to oppose the presence of mosques in their communities When told to fear a particular outgroup Hetherington said On average people who score low in authoritarianism will be like I m not that worried about that while people who score high in authoritarianism will be like Oh my god I m worried about that because the world is a dangerous place In other words what might look on the surface like bigotry was really much closer to Stenner s theory of activation that authoritarians are unusually susceptible to messages about the ways outsiders and social changes threaten America and so lash out at groups that are identified as objects of concern at that given moment That s not to say that such an attitude is in some way better than simple racism or xenophobia it is still dangerous and damaging especially if it empowers frightening demagogues like Donald Trump Perhaps more to the point it helps explain how Trump s supporters have come to so quickly embrace such extreme policies targeting these outgroups mass deportation of millions of people a ban on foreign Muslims visiting the US When you think about those policy preferences as driven by authoritarianism in which social threats are perceived as especially dangerous and as demanding extreme responses rather than the sudden emergence of specific bigotries this starts to make a lot more sense VIII What authoritarians want From our parenting questions we learned who the GOP authoritarians are From our questions about threats and social change we learned what s motivating them But the final set of questions on policy preferences might be the most important of all So what What do authoritarians actually want The responses to our policy questions showed that authoritarians have their own set of policy preferences distinct from GOP orthodoxy And those preferences mean that in real and important ways authoritarians are their own distinct constituency effectively a new political party within the GOP What stands out from the results Feldman wrote after reviewing our data is that authoritarians are most willing to want to use force to crack down on immigration and limit civil liberties This action side of authoritarianism he believed was the key thing that distinguished Trump supporters from supporters of other GOP candidates The willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats that is most clear among Trump supporters Authoritarians generally and Trump voters specifically we found were highly likely to support five policies Using military force over diplomacy against countries that threaten the United States Changing the Constitution to bar citizenship for children of illegal immigrants Imposing extra airport checks on passengers who appear to be of Middle Eastern descent in order to curb terrorism Requiring all citizens to carry a national ID card at all times to show to a police officer on request to curb terrorism Allowing the federal government to scan all phone calls for calls to any number linked to terrorism What these policies share in common is an outsize fear of threats physical and social and more than that a desire to meet those threats with severe government action with policies that are authoritarian not just in style but in actuality The scale of the desired response is in some ways what most distinguishes authoritarians from the rest of the GOP Many Republicans seem to be threatened by terrorism violence and cultural diversity but that s not unique to Trump supporters Feldman told me It seems to be the action side of authoritarianism the willingness to use government power to eliminate the threats that is most clear among Trump supporters he added If Trump loses the election that won t remove the threats and social changes that trigger the action side of authoritarianism This helps explain why the GOP has had such a hard time co opting Trump s supporters even though those supporters immediate policy concerns such as limiting immigration or protecting national security line up with party orthodoxy The real divide is over how far to go in responding And the party establishment is simply unwilling to call for such explicitly authoritarian policies Just as striking is what was missing from authoritarians concerns There was no clear correlation between authoritarianism and support for tax cuts for people making more than per year for example And the same was true of support for international trade agreements These are both issues associated with mainstream GOP economic policies All groups opposed the tax cuts and support for trade agreements was evenly lukewarm across all degrees of authoritarianism So there is no real divide on these issues But there is one more factor that our data couldn t capture but is nevertheless important Trump s style Trump s specific policies aren t the thing that most sets him apart from the rest of the field of GOP candidates Rather it s his rhetoric and style The way he reduces everything to black and white extremes of strong versus weak greatest versus worst His simple direct promises that he can solve problems that other politicians are too weak to manage And perhaps most importantly his willingness to flout all the conventions of civilized discourse when it comes to the minority groups that authoritarians find so threatening That s why it s a benefit rather than a liability for Trump when he says Mexicans are rapists or speaks gleefully of massacring Muslims with pig blood tainted bullets He is sending a signal to his authoritarian supporters that he won t let political correctness hold him back from attacking the outgroups they fear This Feldman explained to me is classic authoritarian leadership style simple powerful and punitive IX How authoritarians will change the GOP and American politics Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz confront Trump during the February GOP debate Michael Ciaglo Pool Getty Images To my surprise the most compelling conclusion to come out of our polling data wasn t about Trump at all Rather it was that authoritarians as a growing presence in the GOP are a real constituency that exists independently of Trump and will persist as a force in American politics regardless of the fate of his candidacy If Trump loses the election that will not remove the threats and social changes that trigger the action side of authoritarianism The authoritarians will still be there They will still look for candidates who will give them the strong punitive leadership they desire And that means Donald Trump could be just the first of many Trumps in American politics with potentially profound implications for the country It would also mean more problems for the GOP This election is already showing that the party establishment abhors Trump and all he stands for his showy demagoguery his disregard for core conservative economic values his divisiveness We may now have a de facto three party system the Democrats the GOP establishment and the GOP authoritarians But while the party may try to match Trump s authoritarian rhetoric and its candidates may grudgingly embrace some of his harsher policies toward immigrants or Muslims in the end a mainstream political party cannot fully commit to extreme authoritarian action the way Trump can That will be a problem for the party Just look at where the Tea Party has left the Republican establishment The Tea Party delivered the House to the GOP in but ultimately left the party in an unresolved civil war Tea Party candidates have challenged moderates and centrists leaving the GOP caucus divided and chaotic Now a similar divide is playing out at the presidential level with results that are even more destructive for the Republican Party Authoritarians may be a slight majority within the GOP and thus able to force their will within the party but they are too few and their views too unpopular to win a national election on their own And so the rise of authoritarianism as a force within American politics means we may now have a de facto three party system the Democrats the GOP establishment and the GOP authoritarians And although the latter two groups are presently forced into an awkward coalition the GOP establishment has demonstrated a complete inability to regain control over the renegade authoritarians and the authoritarians are actively opposed to the establishment s centrist goals and uninterested in its economic platform Over time this will have significant political consequences for the Republican Party It will become more difficult for Republican candidates to win the presidency because the candidates who can win the nomination by appealing to authoritarian primary voters will struggle to court mainstream voters in the general election They will have less trouble with local and congressional elections but that might just mean more legislative gridlock as the GOP caucus struggles to balance the demands of authoritarian and mainstream legislators The authoritarian base will drag the party further to the right on social issues and will simultaneously erode support for traditionally conservative economic policies And in the meantime the forces activating American authoritarians seem likely to only grow stronger Norms around gender sexuality and race will continue evolving Movements like Black Lives Matter will continue chipping away at the country s legacy of institutionalized discrimination pursuing the kind of social change and reordering of society that authoritarians find so threatening The chaos in the Middle East which allows groups like ISIS to flourish and sends millions of refugees spilling into other countries shows no sign of improving Longer term if current demographic trends continue white Americans will cease to be a majority over the coming decades In the long run this could mean a GOP that is even more hard line on immigration and on policing that is more outspoken about fearing Muslims and other minority groups but also takes a softer line on traditional party economic issues like tax cuts It will be a GOP that continues to perform well in congressional and local elections but whose divisions leave the party caucus divided to the point of barely functioning and perhaps eventually unable to win the White House For decades the Republican Party has been winning over authoritarians by implicitly promising to stand firm against the tide of social change and to be the party of force and power rather than the party of negotiation and compromise But now it may be discovering that its strategy has worked too well and threatens to tear the party apart ", "label": "pos"},
	{ "text": "On Monday Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester New Hampshire where he merrily repeated a woman in the crowd who called Ted Cruz a pussy Twenty four hours later Donald Trump won the New Hampshire primary in a landslide I m not here to clutch my pearls over Trump s vulgarity what was telling rather was the immaturity of the moment the glee Trump took in his she said it I didn t game The media which has grown used to covering Trump as a sideshow delighted in the moment along with him it was funny and it meant clicks takes traffic But it was more than that It was the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president showing off the demagogue s instinct for amplifying the angriest voice in the mob It is undeniably enjoyable to watch Trump He s red faced discursive funny angry strange unpredictable and real He speaks without filter and tweets with reckless abandon The Donald Trump phenomenon is a riotous union of candidate ego and voter id America s most skilled political entertainer is putting on the greatest show we ve ever seen It s so fun to watch that it s easy to lose sight of how terrifying it really is Trump is the most dangerous major candidate for president in memory He pairs terrible ideas with an alarming temperament he s a racist a sexist and a demagogue but he s also a narcissist a bully and a dilettante He lies so constantly and so fluently that it s hard to know if he even realizes he s lying He delights in schoolyard taunts and luxuriates in backlash Donald Trump Campaigns Across New Hampshire Ahead Of Primary Day Photo by Joe Raedle Getty Images Trump is in serious contention to win the Republican presidential nomination His triumph in a general election is unlikely but it is far from impossible He s not a joke and he s not a clown He s a man who could soon be making decisions of war and peace who would decide which regulations are enforced and which are lifted who would be responsible for nominating Supreme Court justices and representing America in the community of nations This is not political entertainment This is politics Trump s path to power has been unnerving His business is licensing out his own name as a symbol of opulence He has endured bankruptcies and scandal by bragging his way out of them He rose to prominence in the Republican Party as a leader of the birther movement He climbed to the top of the polls in this election by calling Mexicans rapists and killers He defended a poor debate performance by accusing Megyn Kelly of being on her period He responded to rival Ted Cruz s surge by calling for a travel ban on Muslims When two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and said they did it because Donald Trump was right all these illegals need to be deported he brushed off complaints that he s inspiring violence by saying his supporters are very passionate Behind Trump s success is an unerring instinct for harnessing anger resentment and fear His view of the economy is entirely zero sum for Americans to win others must lose We re going to make America great again he said in his New Hampshire victory speech but we re going to do it the old fashioned way We re going to beat China Japan beat Mexico at trade We re going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis It s not going to happen anymore Trump answers America s rage with more rage As the journalist Molly Ball observed All the other candidates say Americans are angry and I understand Trump says I M angry Trump doesn t offer solutions so much as he offers villains His message isn t so much that he ll help you as he ll hurt them Donald Trump Holds New Hampshire Primary Night Gathering In Manchester Photo by Joe Raedle Getty Images Trump s other gift the one that gets less attention but is perhaps more important is his complete lack of shame It s easy to underestimate how important shame is in American politics But shame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery Most people feel shame when they re exposed as liars when they re seen as uninformed when their behavior is thought cruel when respected figures in their party condemn their actions when experts dismiss their proposals when they are mocked and booed and protested Trump doesn t He has the reality television star s ability to operate entirely without shame and that permits him to operate entirely without restraint It is the single scariest facet of his personality It is the one that allows him to go where others won t to say what others can t to do what others wouldn t Trump lives by the reality television trope that he s not here to make friends But the reason reality television villains always say they re not there to make friends is because it sets them apart makes them unpredictable and fun to watch I m not here to make friends is another way of saying I m not bound by the social conventions of normal people The rest of us are here to make friends and it makes us boring gentle kind This more than his ideology is why Trump genuinely scares me There are places where I think his instincts are an improvement on the Republican field He seems more dovish than neoconservatives like Marco Rubio and less dismissive of the social safety net than libertarians like Rand Paul But those candidates are checked by institutions and incentives that hold no sway over Trump his temperament is so immature his narcissism so clear his political base so unique his reactions so strange that I honestly have no idea what he would do or what he wouldn t do When MSNBC s Joe Scarborough asked Trump about his affection for Vladimir Putin who kills journalists political opponents and invades countries Trump replied He s running his country and at least he s a leader unlike what we have in this country Later he clarified that he doesn t actually condone killing journalists but he warned the crowd I do hate them It s a lie that if you put a frog into a pot of water and slowly turn up the heat the frog will simply boil but it s a fact that if you put the American political system in a room with Trump for long enough we slowly lose track of how noxious he is or we at least run out of ways to keep repeating it But tonight is a night to repeat it There is something scary in Donald Trump We should fear his rise ",

	{ "text": "There is a smug style in American liberalism It has been growing these past decades It is a way of conducting politics predicated on the belief that American life is not divided by moral difference or policy divergence not really but by the failure of half the country to know what s good for them In the smug style has found expression in media and in policy in the attitudes of liberals both visible and private providing a foundational set of assumptions above which a great number of liberals comport their understanding of the world It has led an American ideology hitherto responsible for a great share of the good accomplished over the past century of our political life to a posture of reaction and disrespect a condescending defensive sneer toward any person or movement outside of its consensus dressed up as a monopoly on reason The smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography Beginning in the middle of the th century the working class once the core of the coalition began abandoning the Democratic Party In in the immediate wake of Franklin Roosevelt percent of manual laborers voted for Democrats along with percent of farmers In it was percent of working class voters By it was percent The white working class in particular saw even sharper declines Despite historic advantages with both poor and middle class white voters by Democrats possessed only a point advantage among poor white voters Among white voters making between and per year the GOP has taken a point lead Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful hapless rubes smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt The consequence was a shift in liberalism s intellectual center of gravity A movement once fleshed out in union halls and little magazines shifted into universities and major press from the center of the country to its cities and elite enclaves Minority voters remained but bereft of the material and social capital required to dominate elite decision making they were largely excluded from an agenda driven by the new Democratic core the educated the coastal and the professional It is not that these forces captured the party so much as it fell to them When the laborer left they remained The origins of this shift are overdetermined Richard Nixon bears a large part of the blame but so does Bill Clinton The Southern Strategy yes but the destruction of labor unions too I have my own sympathies but I do not propose to adjudicate that question here Suffice it to say by the s the better part of the working class wanted nothing to do with the word liberal What remained of the American progressive elite was left to puzzle What happened to our coalition Why did they abandon us What s the matter with Kansas The smug style arose to answer these questions It provided an answer so simple and so emotionally satisfying that its success was perhaps inevitable the theory that conservatism and particularly the kind embraced by those out there in the country was not a political ideology at all Learn more How politics makes us stupid The trouble is that stupid hicks don t know what s good for them They re getting conned by right wingers and tent revivalists until they believe all the lies that ve made them so wrong They don t know any better That s why they re voting against their own self interest As anybody who has gone through a particularly nasty breakup knows disdain cultivated in the aftermath of a divide quickly exceeds the original grievance You lose somebody You blame them Soon the blame is reason enough to keep them at a distance the excuse to drive them even further away Finding comfort in the notion that their former allies were disdainful hapless rubes smug liberals created a culture animated by that contempt The result is a self fulfilling prophecy Financial incentive compounded this tendency there is money after all in reassuring the bitter Over years an industry arose to cater to the smug style It began in humor and culminated for a time in The Daily Show a program that more than any other thing advanced the idea that liberal orthodoxy was a kind of educated savvy and that its opponents were before anything else stupid The smug liberal found relief in ridiculing them The internet only made it worse Today a liberal who finds himself troubled by the currents of contemporary political life need look no further than his Facebook newsfeed to find the explanation Study finds Daily Show viewers more informed than viewers of Fox News They re beating CNN watchers too NPR listeners are best informed of all He likes that You re better off watching nothing than watching Fox He likes that even more The good news doesn t stop Liberals aren t just better informed They re smarter They ve got better grammar They know more words Smart kids grow up to be liberals while conservatives reason like drunks Liberals are better able to process new information they re less biased like that They ve got different brains Better ones Why Evolution They ve got better brains top notch amygdalae science finds The smug style created a feedback loop If the trouble with conservatives was ignorance then the liberal impulse was to correct it When such corrections failed disdain followed after it Of course there is a smug style in every political movement elitism among every ideology believing itself in possession of the solutions to society s ills But few movements have let the smug tendency so corrupt them or make so tenuous its case against its enemies Conservatives are always at a bit of a disadvantage in the theater of mass democracy the conservative editorialist Kevin Williamson wrote in National Review last October because people en masse aren t very bright or sophisticated and they re vulnerable to cheap hysterical emotional appeals The smug style thinks Williamson is wrong of course but not in principle It s only that he s confused about who the hordes of stupid hysterical people are voting for The smug style reads Williamson and says No You Elites real elites might recognize one another by their superior knowledge The smug recognize one another by their mutual knowing Knowing for example that the Founding Fathers were all secular deists Knowing that you re actually like times more likely to shoot yourself than an intruder Knowing that those fools out in Kansas are voting against their own self interest and that the trouble is Kansas doesn t know any better Knowing all the jokes that signal this knowledge The studies about Daily Show viewers and better sized amygdalae are knowing It is the smug style s first premise a politics defined by a command of the Correct Facts and signaled by an allegiance to the Correct Culture A politics that is just the politics of smart people in command of Good Facts A politics that insists it has no ideology at all only facts No moral convictions only charts the kind that keep them from imposing their morals like the bad guys do Knowing is the shibboleth into the smug style s culture a cultural that celebrates hip commitments and valorizes hip taste that loves nothing more than hate reading anyone who doesn t get them A culture that has come to replace politics itself The knowing know that police reform that abortion rights that labor unions are important but go no further What is important after all is to signal that you know these things What is important is to launch links and mockery at those who don t The Good Facts are enough Anybody who fails to capitulate to them is part of the Problem is terminally uncool No persuasion only retweets Eye roll crying emoji forward to John Oliver for sick burns The smug style has always existed in American liberalism but it wasn t always so totalizing Lionel Trilling claimed as far back as that liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition that the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not express themselves in ideas but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas The smug style has always existed in American liberalism but it wasn t always so totalizing Richard Hofstadter the historian whose most famous work The Paranoid Style in American Politics this essay exists in some obvious reference to advanced a similar line in writing not so well remembered today His then influential history writing drips with disdain for rubes who regard themselves as victimized by economics and history who have failed to maintain correct political attitudes But years ago American liberalism relied too much on the support of working people to let these ideas take too much hold Even its elitists its Schlesingers and Bells were tempered by the power of the labor movement by the role Marxism still played in even liberal politics forces too powerful to allow non elite concerns to entirely escape the liberal mental horizon Walter Reuther and Bayard Rustin and A Philip Randolph were still in the room and they mattered Sixty years ago the ugliest tendencies were still private too The smug style belonged to real elites knowing in their cocktail parties far from the ears of rubes But today we have television and the internet and a liberalism worked out in universities and think tanks Today the better part of liberalism is Trillings or those who d like to be at any rate and everyone can hear them On June the Supreme Court found that denying marriage licenses to same sex couples constituted a violation of the th Amendment After decades of protests legislation setbacks and litigation the states still holding out against the inevitable were ordered to relent Kim Davis a clerk tasked with issuing marriage licenses to couples in her Kentucky county refused At the distance of six months it is surprising that she was beyond a few short lived and empty efforts the only civil bureaucrat to do so One imagines a hundred or a thousand Kim Davises in the country small administrators with small power outraged by the collapse of a moral fight that they were winning just a few years prior In the days between the June decision and the July announcement that the American Civil Liberties Union would represent four couples who had been denied marriage licenses by the Rowan County Clerk s office many braced for resistance Surely compliance would come hard in some places Surely some of the losers would refuse to give up There was something giddy about it at long last the good guys would be the ones bearing down with the full force of the law It did not take long for the law to correct Davis On August a judge ordered a stay preventing Davis from refusing any further under the protection of the law The Sixth Circuit and then the Supreme Court refused to hear her appeal Despite further protest and Davis s ultimate jailing for contempt of court normal service was restored in short order The people of Rowan Country suffered all told slightly less than seven weeks without a functioning civil licensure apparatus Davis remained a fixation Dour rural thrice divorced but born again Twitter could not have invented a better parody of the uncool She was ridiculed for her politics but also for her looks that she had been married so many times was inexplicable That she thought she had the slightest grasp of the Constitution doubly so When Davis was jailed for five days following her refusal to comply with the court order many who pride themselves on having a vastly more compassionate moral foundation than Davis cheered the imprisonment of a political foe The ridicule of Davis became so pronounced that even smug circles always on the precipice of self reproach began eventually to rein in the excess Mocking her appearance openly celebrating the incarceration of an ideological opponent these were not good looks Kim Davis at a rally in September Ty Wright Getty Images But a more fundamental element of smug disdain for Kim Davis went unchallenged the contention at bottom that Davis was not merely wrong in her convictions but that her convictions were in themselves an error and a fraud That is Kim Davis was not only on the wrong side of the law She was not even a subscriber to a religious ideology that had found itself at moral odds with American culture Rather she was a subscriber to nothing a hateful bigot who did not even understand her own religion Christianity as many hastened to point out is about love Christ commands us to render unto Caesar what is Caesar s If the Bible took any position on the issue at all it was that divorce beloved by Davis was a sin and that she was a hypocrite masquerading among the faithful How many of these critiques were issued by atheists This more than anything I can recall in recent American life is an example of the smug style Many liberals do not believe that evangelical Christianity ought to guide public life many believe moreover that the moral conceits of that Christianity are wrong even harmful to society But to the smug liberal it isn t that Kim Davis is wrong How can she be She s only mistaken She just doesn t know the Good Facts even about her own religion She s angry and confused another hick who s not with it It was an odd thing to assert in the case of Christianity a religion that until recently was taken to be another shibboleth of the uncool not a loving faith misunderstood by bigots But this is knowing knowing that the new line on Jesus is that the homophobes just don t get their own faith Kim Davis was behind the times Her beliefs did not represent a legitimate challenge to liberal consensus because they did not represent a challenge at all They were incoherent at odds with the Good Facts Google makes every man a theologian This I think is fundamental to understanding the smug style If good politics and good beliefs are just Good Facts and good tweets that is if there is no ideology beyond sensible conclusions drawn from a rational assessment of the world then there are no moral fights only lying liars and the stupid rubes who believe them When Davis was first released from county jail Mike Huckabee went to meet her But the smug style sees no true ideology there no moral threat to contend with Only a huckster and a hick one to be ridiculed and the other to be refuted What more the smug man posts could there be to say about it They re idiots Look look This Onion article nails it Popular story Adlai Stevenson Democratic candidate for president is on parade A band is playing Onlookers cheer He waves to the crowd A woman shouts Gov Stevenson you have the vote of every thinking person in this country Stevenson replies Thank you ma am but we need a majority The smug style says to itself Yeah I really am one of the few thinking people in this country aren t I In November of last year during the week when it became temporarily fashionable for American governors to declare that Syrian refugees would not be welcome in their state Hamilton Nolan wrote an essay for Gawker called Dumb Hicks Are America s Greatest Threat If there has ever been a tirade so dedicated to the smug style to the proposition that it is neither malice nor capital nor ideological difference but rather the backward stupidity of poor people that has ruined the state of American policy then it is hidden beyond our view in some uncool place far from the front page of Gawker Learn more Why have weddings and houses gotten so ridiculously expensive Blame inequality Many of America s political leaders are warning of the dangers posed by Syrian refugees They are underestimating though the much greater danger dumbass hicks in charge of things Nolan wrote You our elected officials are embarrassing us All of us except your fellow dumb hicks who voted for you in large numbers You our racist xenophobic knuckle dragging ignorant leaders are making us look bad in front of the guests the whole world You are the bad cousin in the family who always ruins Thanksgiving Go in the back room and drink a can of beer alone please Among the dumb hicks Nolan identifies are many Southern mayors and many lesser known state representatives He cites the Ku Klux Klan exclusively dumbass hicks he writes he emphasizes despite the fact that the New York Times in an investigation of white supremacist members of Stormfront org found that the top reported interest of Stormfront members is reading That they are news and political junkies Despite the fact that if you come compare Stormfront users to people who go to the Yahoo News site it turns out that the Stormfront crowd is twice as likely to visit nytimes com They have long threads praising Breaking Bad and discussing the comparative merits of online dating sites like Plenty of Fish and OKCupid the Times reports In another piece published later the same month Nolan wrote that Inequality of wealth or if you like the distribution of wealth in our society in a way that results in poverty is not just one issue among many It is the root from which blooms nearly all major social problems He s right about that But who does he imagine is responsible for this inequality The poor The dumb The hicks Hamilton Nolan isn t stupid He has even lately argued that even the worst of the rubes must be allies in class struggle Yet the trouble is still swallowing what motherfuckers those people are Nolan is perhaps the funniest and most articulate of those pointing fingers at the dumbass hicks but he isn t alone It is evidently intolerable to a huge swath of liberalism to confess the obvious that those responsible have homes in Brooklyn too That they buy the same smartphones That they too are on Twitter That the oligarchs are making fun of stupid poor people too That they re better at it and always will be No The trouble must be out there somewhere In the country Where the idiots are where the hicks are too stupid to know where problems blossom To the dumb hick leaders of America I say nothing You wouldn t listen anyhow Nolan writes My words would go in one ear and right out the other Like talking to an old block of wood It s a shame They might be receptive to his concerns about poverty If there is a single person who exemplifies the dumbass hick in the smug imagination it is former President George W Bush He s got the accent He can t talk right He seems stupefied by simple concepts and his politics are all gee whiz Texas ignorance He is the ur hick He is the enemy He got all the way to White House and he s still being taken for a ride by the scheming rightwing oligarchs around him just like those poor rubes in Kansas If only George knew Dick Cheney wasn t acting in his own best interests It is worth considering that Bush is the son of a president a patrician born in Connecticut and educated at Andover and Harvard and Yale It is worth considering that he does not come from a family known for producing poor minds It is worth considering that beginning with his gubernatorial debate against Ann Richards and at every juncture thereafter opponents have been defeated after days of media outlets openly speculating whether George was up to the mental challenge of a one on one debate Throughout his short political career ABC s Katy Textor wrote on the eve of the debates against Al Gore Bush has benefited from low expectations of his debating abilities The fact that he skipped no less than three GOP primary debates and the fact that he was reluctant to agree to the Commission on Presidential Debates proposal has done little to contradict the impression of a candidate uncomfortable with this unavoidable fact of campaign life Done little to contradict George W Bush and Al Gore

What an idiot American liberals made fun of him for that one for years It is worth considering that he didn t misspeak He did however deliberately cultivate the confusion He understood the smug style He wagered that many liberals eager to see their opponents as intellectually deficient would buy into the act and thereby miss the more pernicious fact of his moral deficits He wagered correctly Smug liberals said George was too stupid to get elected too stupid to get reelected too stupid to pass laws or appoint judges or weather a political fight Liberals misunderestimated George W Bush all eight years of his presidency George W Bush is not a dumbass hick In eight years all the sick Daily Show burns in the world did not appreciably undermine his agenda The smug mind defends itself against these charges Oh we re just having fun it says We don t mean it This is just for a laugh it s just a joke stop being so humorless It is exasperating after all to have to live in a country where so many people are so aggressively wrong about so much they say You go on about ideology and shibboleths and knowing but we are right on the issues aren t we We are right on social policy and right on foreign policy and right on evolution and same sex marriage and climate change too Surely that s what matters We don t really mean they re all stupid but hey lay off We re not smug This is just how we vent our frustration Otherwise it would be too depressing having to share a country with these people We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief and not for instance the animating public strategy of an entire wing of the liberal culture apparatus The Daily Show as it happens is not the private entertainment of elites blowing off some steam It is broadcast on national television Twitter isn t private Not that anybody with the sickest burn to accompany the smartest chart would want it to be Otherwise how would everyone know how in the know you are The rubes have seen your videos You posted it on their wall Still don t get why liberal opinion is correct This video settles the debate for good I have been wondering for a long time how it is that so many entries to the op ed pages take it as their justifying premise that they are arguing for a truth that has never been advanced before We have long passed the point where blithe ridicule of the American right can be credibly cast as private stress relief It s an accepted nearly unchallenged assumption that Muslim communities across the U S have a problem that their youth tend toward violent ideology or are susceptible to radicalization by groups like the Islamic State began an editorial that appeared last December in the New York Times But after all it goes on the majority of mass shootings in America are perpetrated by white men but no one questions what might have radicalized them in their communities But this contention that Muslims possess superlative violent tendencies has been challenged countless times hasn t it It was challenged here and here and here as far back as The president of the United State challenged it on national television the night before this editorial was published The Times itself did too The myopic provincialism of anybody who believes that Muslims are a uniquely violent people is the basis of a five year old Onion headline not some new moral challenge The smug style leaves its adherents no other option If an idea has failed to take hold if the Good Facts are not widely accepted then the problem must be that these facts have not yet reached the disbelievers In December Public Policy Polling found that percent of Republicans were in favor of bombing Agrabah the Arab sounding fictional city from Disney s Aladdin Hilarious PPP has run joke questions before of course polling the popularity of Deez Nuts or asking after God s job approval But these questions at least let their audience in on the gag Now liberalism is deliberately setting up the last segment of the population actually willing to endure a phone survey in service of what it knew would make for some hilarious copy when the rubes inevitably fell for it This is not a survey in service of a joke it is a survey in service of a human punchline As if only Republicans covered up gaps in their knowledge by responding to what they assume is a good faith question by guessing from their general principles It may be easy to mistake with the private venting of frustrated elites but the rubes can read the New York Times too It is not where liberals whisper to each other about the secret things that go unchallenged Poll respondents are not the secret fodder for a joke Learn more Late breaking sexism why younger women aren t excited about electing a woman president This is the consequence of private venting and it is the consequence of knowing too If good politics comes solely from good data and good sense it cannot be that large sections of the American public are merely wrong about so many vital things It cannot be that they have heard our arguments but rejected them that might mean we must examine our own methods of persuasion No it is only that the wrong beliefs are unchallenged that their believers are trapped in information bubbles and confirmation bias That no one knows the truth except the New York Times or Vox If only we could tell them question them show them this graph If they don t get it then well then they re hopeless The smug style plays out in private too of course If you haven t started one yourself you ve surely seen the Facebook threads Ten or of Brooklyn s finest gather to say how exasperated they are these days by the stupidity of the American public I just don t know what to do about these people one posts I think we have to accept that a lot of people are just misinformed replies another Like I think they actually don t want to know anything that would undermine their worldview They tend to do it in the comment section under an article about how conservatives are difficult to persuade because they isolate themselves in mutually reinforcing information bubbles What have been the consequences of the smug style It has become a tradition for the smug in editorials and essay and confident Facebook boasting to assume that the presidential debates will feature their candidate in command of the facts wiping the floor with the empty huckster ignorance of their Republican opponent It was popularly assumed for a time that George W Bush was too stupid to be elected president The smug believed the same of Ronald Reagan John Yoo the architect of the Bush administration s torture policies escaped The Daily Show unscathed Liberals wondered what to do when Jon Stewart fails What would success look like Were police waiting in the wings a one way ticket to the Hague if Stewart nailed him It would be unfair to say that the smug style has never learned from these mistakes But the lesson has been We underestimated how many people could be fooled That is We underestimated just how dumb these dumb hicks really are We just didn t get our message to them They just stayed in their information bubble We can t let the lying liars keep lying to these people but how do we reach these idiots who only trust Fox Rarely Maybe they re savvier than we thought Maybe they re angry for a reason As it happens reasons aren t too difficult to come by During a San Francisco fundraiser in the primary campaign Barack Obama offered an observation that was hailed not without some glee as the first unforced error from then Senator Cool You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania Obama said and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest the jobs have been gone now for years and nothing s replaced them And they fell through the Clinton administration and the Bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not And it s not surprising then they get bitter They cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren t like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations It s the latter part that we remember eight years later the clinging to guns and religion and hate but it is the first part that was important the part about lost jobs and neglect by two presidential administrations Obama s observation was not novel The notion that material loss and abandonment have driven America s white working class into a fit of resentment is boilerplate for even the Democratic Party s tepid left these days But in the president s formulation and in the formulation of smug stylists who have embraced some material account of uncool attitudes the downturn the jobs lost and the opportunities narrowed are a force of nature something that has been happening in the passive voice If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence it s Why are they voting against their own self interest This I suspect will one day become the Republican Party s rationale for addressing climate change Look we don t know how the dead hooker wound up in the hotel room But she s here now that s undeniable so we ve gotta get rid of the body Today it is the excuse of American smug mind Where did all of these poor people come from If pressed for an answer I suppose they would say Republicans elected by rubes voting against their own self interest Reagan Gingrich Bush all those Bad Fact knowing halfwits who were too dumb to get elected to anything Well sure In the past years of American life the Republican Party has dedicated itself to replacing every labor law with a photo of Ronald Reagan s face But this does not excuse liberals beating full retreat to the colleges and the cities abandoning the dispossessed to their fate It does not excuse surrendering a century of labor politics in the name of electability It does not excuse gazing out decades later to find that those left behind are not up on the latest thought and deciding We didn t abandon them The idiots didn t want to be saved It was not Ronald Reagan who declared the era of big government It was not the GOP that decided the coastally based culturally liberal industries of technology Hollywood and high finance were the future of the American economy If the smug style can be reduced to a single sentence it s Why are they voting against their own self interest But no party these past decades has effectively represented the interests of these dispossessed Only one has made a point of openly disdaining them too Abandoned and without any party willing to champion their interests people cling to candidates who at the very least are willing to represent their moral convictions The smug style resents them for it and they resent the smug in turn The rubes noticed that liberal Democrats distressed by the notion that Indiana would allow bakeries to practice open discrimination against LGBTQ couples threatened boycotts against the state mobilizing the considerable economic power that comes with an alliance of New York and Hollywood and Silicon Valley to punish retrograde Gov Mike Pence but had no such passion when the same governor of the same state joined others in refusing the Medicaid expansion No doubt good liberals objected to that move too But I ve yet to see a boycott threat about it Early in the marriage equality fight activists advanced the theory that when people discovered a friend or relative was gay they became far more likely to support gay rights They were correct These days it is difficult for anybody in a position of liberal power whether in business or government or media to avoid having openly gay colleagues colleagues whom they like and whom they d like to help But few opinion makers fraternize with the impoverished Few editors and legislators and Silicon Valley heroes have dinner with the lovely couple on food stamps down the road much less those scraping by in Indiana If any single event provided the direct impetus for this essay it was a running argument I had with an older liberal writer over the seriousness of Donald Trump s presidential campaign Since June when Trump announced his candidacy this writer has taken it upon himself each day to tell his Facebook followers that Donald Trump is a bad kind of dude That saying as much was the key to stopping him and his odious followers too Ridicule is the most powerful weapon we have against any of our enemies he told me in the end but especially against the ones who not incorrectly take it so personally and lash out in ways that shine klieg lights on those very flaws we detest If you re laughing at someone you re certainly not respecting him Anyway he went on I m done talking to you We see the world differently I m fine with that We don t need to be friends Ridicule is the most effective political tactic Ridicule is especially effective when it s personal and about expressing open disdain for stupid bad people Political legitimacy is granted by the respect of elite liberals You can t be legitimate if you re the butt of our jokes If you don t agree we can t work together politically We can t even be friends because politics is social Because politics is performative if we don t mock together we aren t on the same side If there is a bingo card for the smug style somewhere then cross off every square You ve won I would be less troubled if I did not believe that the smug style has captured an enormous section of American liberalism If I believed that its politics as practiced by its supporters extended beyond this line of thought If this were an exception But even as many have come around to the notion that Trump is the prohibitive favorite for his party s nomination the smug interpretation has been predictable We only underestimated how hateful how stupid the Republican base can be A Donald Trump rally in Pittsburgh Jeff Swensen Getty Images Trump capturing the nomination will not dispel the smug style if anything it will redouble it Faced with the prospect of an election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton the smug will reach a fever pitch six straight months of a sure thing an opportunity to mock and scoff and ask How could anybody vote for this guy until a morning in November when they ask What the fuck happened On March Salon s David Masciotra wrote that if Trump actually had the strength to articulate uncomfortable and inconvenient truths he would turn his favorite word loser not on full time professionals in the press but on his supporters Masciotra goes on Journalists found that in the counties where Trump is most dominant there are large numbers of white high school dropouts and unemployed people no longer looking for work An alliance with the incoherent personality cult of Donald Trump s candidacy correlates strongly with failure to obtain a high school diploma and withdrawal from the labor force The counties also have a consistent history of voting for segregationists and have an above average percentage of its residents living in mobile homes The kicker Many conservatives and even some kindhearted liberals might object to the conclusions one can draw from the data as stereotyping but the empirical evidence leaves little choice Donald Trump s supporters confirm the stereotype against them Here s the conclusion I draw If Donald Trump has a chance in November it is because the knowing will dictate our strategy Unable to countenance the real causes of their collapse they will comfort with own impotence by shouting Idiots again and again angrier and angrier the handmaidens of their own destruction The smug style resists empathy for the unknowing It denies the possibility of a politics whereby those who do not share knowing culture who do not like the right things or know the Good Facts or recognize the intellectual bankruptcy of their own ideas can be worked with in spite of these differences toward a common goal It is this attitude that has driven the dispossessed into the arms of a candidate who shares their fury It is this attitude that may deliver him the White House a serious threat a threat to be mocked and called out and hated but not to be taken seriously The wages of smug is Trump Nothing is more confounding to the smug style than the fact that the average Republican is better educated and has a higher IQ than the average Democrat That for every overpowered study finding superior liberal open mindedness and intellect and knowledge there is one to suggest that Republicans have the better of these qualities Most damning perhaps to the fancy liberal self conception Republicans score higher in susceptibility to persuasion They are willing to change their minds more often The Republican coalition tends toward the center educated enough smart enough informed enough The Democratic coalition in the st century is bifurcated It has the postgraduates but it has the disenfranchised urban poor as well a group better defined by race and immigration status than by class There are more Americans without high school diplomas than in possession of doctoral degrees The math proceeds from there The smug style takes this as a defense Elite liberalism and the Democratic Party by extension cannot hate poor people they say We aren t smug Just look at our coalition These aren t rubes Just look at our embrace of their issues But observe how quickly professed concern for the oppressed becomes another shibboleth for the smug another kind of knowing Mere awareness of these issues becomes the most important thing the capacity to articulate them a new subset of Correct Facts Everyone in the know has read The Case for Reparations but it was the reading and performed admiration that counted praised in the same breath as It is a better history than an actual case for actually paying of course Pretend for a moment that all of it is true That the smug style apprehended the world as it really is that knowing or knowing no inflection did make our political divide That the problem is the rubes That the dumbass hicks are to blame They can t help it Their brains don t work They isolate themselves from all the Good Facts and they re being taken for a ride by con men Pretend the ridicule worked too that the videos and the Twitter burns and destroying the opposition made all the bad guys go away What kind of world would it leave us An endless cycle of jokes Of sick burns and smart tweets and knowing Relative to whom The smug style demands an object of disdain it would find a new one quickly It is central to the liberal self conception that what separates them from reactionaries is a desire to help people a desire to create a fairer and more just world Liberals still want or believe they still want to make a more perfect union Whether you believe they are deluded or not whether you believe this project is worthwhile in any form or not what I am trying to tell you is that the smug style has fundamentally undermined even the aspiration that it has made American liberalism into the worst version of itself It is impossible in the long run to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them It becomes all at once too easy to decide you know best to never hear much less ignore protest to the contrary At present many of those most in need of the sort of help liberals believe they can provide despise liberalism and are despised in turn Is it surprising that with each decade the help on offer drifts even further from the help these people need It is impossible in the long run to cleave the desire to help people from the duty to respect them Even if the two could be separated would it be worth it What kind of political movement is predicated on openly disdaining the very people it is advocating for The smug style at bottom is a failure of empathy Further It is a failure to believe that empathy has any value at all It is the notion that anybody worthy of liberal time and attention and respect must capitulate immediately to the Good Facts If they don t and they won t you re free to write them off and mock them When they suffer it s their just desserts Make no mistake I am not suggesting that liberals adopt a fuzzy gentler version of their politics I am not suggesting they compromise their issues for the sake of playing nice What I am suggesting is that the battles waged by liberalism have drifted far away from their old egalitarian intentions I am suggesting that open disdain for the people they say they want to help has led them to stop helping those people too I am suggesting that in the case of a Kim Davis liberalism resist the impulse to go beyond the necessary legal fight and explicitly delight in punishing an old foe I am suggesting that they instead wonder what it might be like to have little left but one s values to wake up one day to find your whole moral order destroyed to look around and see the representatives of a new order call you a stupid hypocritical hick without bothering even to wonder how your corner of your poor state found itself so alienated from them in the first place To work with people who do not share their values or their tastes who do not live where they live or like what they like or know their Good Facts or their jokes This is not a call for civility Manners are not enough The smug style did not arise by accident and it cannot be abolished with a little self reproach So long as liberals cannot find common cause with the larger section of the American working class they will search for reasons to justify that failure They will resent them They will find over and over how easy it is to justify abandoning them further They will choose the smug style Maybe the cycle is too deeply set already Perhaps the divide the disdain the whole crack up are inevitable But if liberal good intentions are to make a play for a better future they cannot merely recognize the ways they ve come to hate their former allies They must begin to mend the ways they lost them in the first place ", "label": "pos"},

	{ "text": "The Republican Party s attempt to treat Donald Trump as a normal political candidate would be laughable were it not so perilous to the republic If only he would mouth the party s conservative principles all would be well But of course the entire Trump phenomenon has nothing to do with policy or ideology It has nothing to do with the Republican Party either except in its historic role as incubator of this singular threat to our democracy Trump has transcended the party that produced him His growing army of supporters no longer cares about the party Because it did not immediately and fully embrace Trump because a dwindling number of its political and intellectual leaders still resist him the party is regarded with suspicion and even hostility by his followers Their allegiance is to him and him alone And the source of allegiance We re supposed to believe that Trump s support stems from economic stagnation or dislocation Maybe some of it does But what Trump offers his followers are not economic remedies his proposals change daily What he offers is an attitude an aura of crude strength and machismo a boasting disrespect for the niceties of the democratic culture that he claims and his followers believe has produced national weakness and incompetence His incoherent and contradictory utterances have one thing in common They provoke and play on feelings of resentment and disdain intermingled with bits of fear hatred and anger His public discourse consists of attacking or ridiculing a wide range of others Muslims Hispanics women Chinese Mexicans Europeans Arabs immigrants refugees whom he depicts either as threats or as objects of derision His program such as it is consists chiefly of promises to get tough with foreigners and people of nonwhite complexion He will deport them bar them get them to knuckle under make them pay up or make them shut up That this tough guy get mad and get even approach has gained him an increasingly large and enthusiastic following has probably surprised Trump as much as anyone else Trump himself is simply and quite literally an egomaniac But the phenomenon he has created and now leads has become something larger than him and something far more dangerous Republican politicians marvel at how he has tapped into a hitherto unknown swath of the voting public But what he has tapped into is what the founders most feared when they established the democratic republic the popular passions unleashed the mobocracy Conservatives have been warning for decades about government suffocating liberty But here is the other threat to liberty that Alexis de Tocqueville and the ancient philosophers warned about that the people in a democracy excited angry and unconstrained might run roughshod over even the institutions created to preserve their freedoms As Alexander Hamilton watched the French Revolution unfold he feared in America what he saw play out in France that the unleashing of popular passions would lead not to greater democracy but to the arrival of a tyrant riding to power on the shoulders of the people This phenomenon has arisen in other democratic and quasi democratic countries over the past century and it has generally been called fascism Fascist movements too had no coherent ideology no clear set of prescriptions for what ailed society National socialism was a bundle of contradictions united chiefly by what and who it opposed fascism in Italy was anti liberal anti democratic anti Marxist anti capitalist and anti clerical Successful fascism was not about policies but about the strongman the leader Il Duce Der F hrer in whom could be entrusted the fate of the nation Whatever the problem he could fix it Whatever the threat internal or external he could vanquish it and it was unnecessary for him to explain how Today there is Putinism which also has nothing to do with belief or policy but is about the tough man who single handedly defends his people against all threats foreign and domestic To understand how such movements take over a democracy one only has to watch the Republican Party today These movements play on all the fears vanities ambitions and insecurities that make up the human psyche In democracies at least for politicians the only thing that matters is what the voters say they want vox populi vox Dei A mass political movement is thus a powerful and to those who would oppose it frightening weapon When controlled and directed by a single leader it can be aimed at whomever the leader chooses If someone criticizes or opposes the leader it doesn t matter how popular or admired that person has been He might be a famous war hero but if the leader derides and ridicules his heroism the followers laugh and jeer He might be the highest ranking elected guardian of the party s most cherished principles But if he hesitates to support the leader he faces political death In such an environment every political figure confronts a stark choice Get right with the leader and his mass following or get run over The human race in such circumstances breaks down into predictable categories and democratic politicians are the most predictable There are those whose ambition leads them to jump on the bandwagon They praise the leader s incoherent speeches as the beginning of wisdom hoping he will reward them with a plum post in the new order There are those who merely hope to survive Their consciences won t let them curry favor so shamelessly so they mumble their pledges of support like the victims in Stalin s show trials perhaps not realizing that the leader and his followers will get them in the end anyway RNC chairman Republicans will find common ground with Trump Play Video Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the GOP will find common ground ahead of the general election Reuters A great number will simply kid themselves refusing to admit that something very different from the usual politics is afoot Let the storm pass they insist and then we can pick up the pieces rebuild and get back to normal Meanwhile don t alienate the leader s mass following After all they are voters and will need to be brought back into the fold As for Trump himself let s shape him advise him steer him in the right direction and not incidentally save our political skins What these people do not or will not see is that once in power Trump will owe them and their party nothing He will have ridden to power despite the party catapulted into the White House by a mass following devoted only to him By then that following will have grown dramatically Today less than percent of eligible voters have voted for Trump But if he wins the election his legions will likely comprise a majority of the nation Imagine the power he would wield then In addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command the Justice Department the FBI the intelligence services the military Who would dare to oppose him then Certainly not a Republican Party that lay down before him even when he was comparatively weak And is a man like Trump with infinitely greater power in his hands likely to become more humble more judicious more generous less vengeful than he is today than he has been his whole life Does vast power un corrupt This is how fascism comes to America not with jackboots and salutes although there have been salutes and a whiff of violence but with a television huckster a phony billionaire a textbook egomaniac tapping into popular resentments and insecurities and with an entire national political party out of ambition or blind party loyalty or simply out of fear

	{ "text": "It s impossible to miss the Hillary for Prison signs at Trump rallies At one of the Democratic debates the moderator asked Hillary Clinton whether she would drop out of the race if she were indicted over her private email server Oh for goodness that is not going to happen she said I m not even going to answer that question Based on what I know about the emails the idea of her being indicted or going to prison is nonsensical Nonetheless the belief that Clinton is dishonest and untrustworthy is pervasive A recent New York Times CBS poll found that of Democrats say she cannot be trusted For decades she s been portrayed as a Lady Macbeth involved in nefarious plots branded as a congenital liar and accused of covering up her husband s misconduct from Arkansas to Monica Lewinsky Some of this is sexist caricature Some is stoked by the Hillary is a liar videos that flood Facebook feeds Some of it she brings on herself by insisting on a perimeter or zone of privacy that she protects too fiercely It s a natural impulse given the level of scrutiny she s attracted more than any male politician I can think of I would be dead rich to adapt an infamous Clinton phrase if I could bill for all the hours I ve spent covering just about every scandal that has enveloped the Clintons As an editor I ve launched investigations into her business dealings her fundraising her foundation and her marriage As a reporter my stories stretch back to Whitewater I m not a favorite in Hillaryland That makes what I want to say next surprising Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest and trustworthy The yardsticks I use for measuring a politician s honesty are pretty simple Ever since I was an investigative reporter covering the nexus of money and politics I ve looked for connections between money including campaign donations loans Super Pac funds speaking fees foundation ties and official actions I m on the lookout for lies scrutinizing statements candidates make in the heat of an election The connection between money and action is often fuzzy Many investigative articles about Clinton end up raising serious questions about potential conflicts of interest or lapses in her judgment Of course she should be held accountable It was bad judgment as she has said to use a private email server It was colossally stupid to take those hefty speaking fees but not corrupt There are no instances I know of where Clinton was doing the bidding of a donor or benefactor As for her statements on issues Politifact a Pulitzer prize winning fact checking organization gives Clinton the best truth telling record of any of the presidential candidates She beats Sanders and Kasich and crushes Cruz and Trump who has the biggest pants on fire rating and has told whoppers about basic economics that are embarrassing for anyone aiming to be president He falsely claimed GDP has dropped the last two quarters and claimed the national unemployment rate was as high as I can see why so many voters believe Clinton is hiding something because her instinct is to withhold As first lady she refused to turn over Whitewater documents that might have tamped down the controversy Instead by not disclosing information she fueled speculation that she was hiding grave wrongdoing In his book about his time working in the Clinton White House All Too Human ABC s George Stephanopoulos wrote that failing to convince the first lady to turn over the records of the Arkansas land deal to the Washington Post was his biggest regret The same pattern of concealment repeats itself through the current campaign in her refusal to release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches So the public is left wondering if she made secret promises to Wall Street or is hiding something else The speeches are probably anodyne politicians always praise their hosts so why not release them Colin Diersing a former student of mine who is a leader of Harvard s Institute of Politics thinks a gender related double standard gets applied to Clinton We expect purity from women candidates he said When she behaves like other politicians or changes positions it s seen as dishonest he adds CBS anchor Scott Pelley seemed to prove Diersing s point when he asked Clinton Have you always told the truth She gave an honest response I ve always tried to always Always Pelley said she was leaving wiggle room What politician wouldn t Clinton distrusts the press more than any politician I have covered In her view journalists breach the perimeter and echo scurrilous claims about her circulated by unreliable rightwing foes I attended a private gathering in South Carolina a month after Bill Clinton was elected in Only a few reporters were invited and we sat together at a luncheon where Hillary Clinton spoke She glared down at us launching into a diatribe about how the press had invaded the Clintons private life The distrust continues These are not new thoughts but they are fundamental to understanding her Tough as she can seem she doesn t have rhino hide and during her husband s first term in the White House according to Her Way a critical and excellent investigative biography of Clinton by Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta she became very depressed during the Whitewater imbroglio A few friends and aides have told me that the email controversy has upset her as badly Like most politicians she s switched some of her positions and sometimes shades the truth In debates with Sanders she cites her tough record on Wall Street but her Senate bills like one curbing executive pay went nowhere She favors ending the carried interest loophole cherished by hedge funds and private equity executives because it taxes their incomes at a lower rate than ordinary income But according to an article by Gerth she did not sign on to bipartisan legislation in that would have closed it She voted for a bankruptcy bill favored by big banks that she initially opposed drawing criticism from Elizabeth Warren Clinton says she improved the bill before voting for passage Her earlier opposition to gay marriage which she later endorsed has hurt her with young people Labor worries about her different statements on trade deals Still Clinton has mainly been constant on issues and changing positions over time is not dishonest It s fair to expect more transparency But it s a double standard to insist on her purity ", "label": "pos"},
	{ "text": "The presidential candidates have wildly varying tax proposals Donald Trump and Ted Cruz propose massive cuts that would greatly reduce federal income taxes on everyone especially the wealthy while cutting a wide host of government programs Meanwhile Bernie Sanders proposes virtually the opposite tax increases on everyone with hikes on the wealthy especially while adding comprehensive government programs And Hillary Clinton proposes much smaller tax increases all focused on the rich But what do their plans mean for your federal tax liability We partnered with the Tax Policy Center to create a calculator that will estimate how each presidential candidate s tax plan would affect you or more accurately people like you For example if you are part of a couple with two children earning a year this calculator tells you the average change in federal taxes for all couples with two children who earn between and a year Before you change your vacation plans based on these numbers keep in mind they are only estimates Every taxpayer has a slightly different situation someone might be deducting business expenses for example while another person will be paying a tax for not carrying insurance coverage This creates millions of different scenarios Accounting for all of that is prohibitively complicated and time consuming But what we have done is simplify the process to consider only the biggest factors income marital status and children and only look at the four taxes with the largest impact individual and corporate income taxes payroll taxes and excise taxes Try it yourself below Note The Tax Policy Center did not perform an analysis of John Kasich s tax plan because his plan lacks sufficient detail to model They have reached out to the Kasich campaign in search of more details and will analyze the plan if they receive enough information to do so The calculator How much does each candidate s tax plan affect you Read this Ezra wrote a piece about what the tax calculator tells us about the candidates On Cruz and Trump he writes In a sense both GOP candidates are gaming the calculator They ve proposed tremendous cuts but without knowing who will pay for those cuts it s hard to know who will truly be helped and who will be badly hurt On Sanders he writes Sanders meanwhile proposes to raise taxes by more than Trump proposes to cut them But it s wrong I think to view Sanders s plan as primarily a change to America s tax code The huge tax increases are a byproduct of Sanders s plans to nationalize major sectors of American life Read the full analysis here Update on why rates are higher than you think We ve been getting a lot of questions about why your current effective tax rate is so high Here s a note from Tax Policy Center director Len Burman that explains why this is happening You might be surprised at how much taxes you re paying under current law We re including payroll taxes excise taxes and corporate income taxes as well as individual income taxes Most working people actually pay more in payroll tax than income tax And they pay much more if you include the employer s portion of the tax Most economists think employers pass their share of the tax on to workers in the form of lower wages Update plus a FAQ section To calculate the tax rate we originally used adjusted gross income AGI but we decided to switch over to expanded cash income ECI because this measure includes income that is not subject to income tax like health insurance premiums paid by employers This allows the calculator to provide a more accurate view of your tax rate For a longer explanation read this Q A What we learned from our calculator Play around with different incomes other than your own to get a better idea of how each candidate deals with the poor middle class and wealthy In short what you ll see is Clinton proposes keeping things mostly the same Sanders wants to implement massive increases across the board including on the poor Cruz and Trump propose big cuts for everyone but the wealthier you are the more you keep in your pocket But how does this affect how much money the federal government brings in It s one thing to know how your taxes will change but you can t view it in a vacuum What the federal government does can affect your bottom line too For example Bernie Sanders s plan would raise taxes on everyone but it would also pay for health care education and other programs that you would no longer have to pay for And it goes the other way too If Donald Trump s tax plan was implemented everyone would get a tax cut but it also means government services would be cut so you would have to pay for them yourself So this is how each candidate deals with this balance Donald Trump His plan would cut federal revenues by an

	{ "text": "In the heat of a presidential campaign you d think that a story about one party s nominee giving a large contribution to a state attorney general who promptly shut down an inquiry into that nominee s scam university would be enormous news But we continue to hear almost nothing about what happened between Donald Trump and Florida attorney general Pam Bondi I raised this issue last week but it s worth an update as well as some contextualization The story re emerged last week when The Post s David A Fahrenthold reported that Trump paid a penalty to the IRS after his foundation made an illegal contribution to Bondi s PAC While the Trump organization characterizes that as a bureaucratic oversight the basic facts are that Bondi s office had received multiple complaints from Floridians who said they were cheated by Trump University while they were looking into it and considering whether to join a lawsuit over Trump University filed by the attorney general of New York State Bondi called Trump and asked him for a donation shortly after getting the check Bondi s office dropped the inquiry At this point we should note that everything here may be completely innocent Perhaps Bondi didn t realize her office was looking into Trump University Perhaps the fact that Trump s foundation made the contribution which to repeat is illegal was just a mix up Perhaps when Trump reimbursed the foundation from his personal account he didn t realize that s not how the law works the foundation would have to get its money back from Bondi s PAC he could then make a personal donation if he wanted Perhaps Bondi s decision not to pursue the case against Trump was perfectly reasonable But here s the thing We don t know the answers to those questions because almost nobody seems to be pursuing them For instance there was only one mention of this story on any of the five Sunday shows when John Dickerson asked Chris Christie about it on Face the Nation Christie took great umbrage I can t believe John that anyone would insult Pam Bondi that way And the comparison with stories about Hillary Clinton s emails or the Clinton Foundation is extremely instructive Whenever we get some new development in any of those Clinton stories you see blanket coverage every cable network every network news program every newspaper investigates it at length And even when the new information serves to exonerate Clinton rather than implicate her in wrongdoing the coverage still emphasizes that the whole thing just raises questions about her integrity The big difference is that there are an enormous number of reporters who get assigned to write stories about those issues regarding Clinton The story of something like the Clinton Foundation gets stretched out over months and months with repeated tellings always with the insistence that questions are being raised and the implication that shady things are going on even if there isn t any evidence at a particular moment to support that idea When it comes to Trump on the other hand we ve seen a very different pattern Here s what happens A story about some kind of corrupt dealing emerges usually from the dogged efforts of one or a few journalists it gets discussed for a couple of days and then it disappears Someone might mention it now and again but the news organizations don t assign a squad of reporters to look into every aspect of it so no new facts are brought to light and no new stories get written The end result of this process is that because of all that repeated examination of Clinton s affairs people become convinced that she must be corrupt to the core It s not that there isn t plenty of negative coverage of Trump because of course there is but it s focused mostly on the crazy things he says on any given day But the truth is that you d have to work incredibly hard to find a politician who has the kind of history of corruption double dealing and fraud that Donald Trump has The number of stories which could potentially deserve hundreds and hundreds of articles is absolutely staggering Here s a partial list Trump s casino bankruptcies which left investors holding the bag while he skedaddled with their money Trump s habit of refusing to pay contractors who had done work for him many of whom are struggling small businesses Trump University which includes not only the people who got scammed and the Florida investigation but also a similar story from Texas where the investigation into Trump U was quashed The Trump Institute another get rich quick scheme in which Trump allowed a couple of grifters to use his name to bilk people out of their money The Trump Network a multi level marketing venture a k a pyramid scheme that involved customers mailing in a urine sample which would be analyzed to produce for them a specially formulated package of multivitamins Trump Model Management which reportedly had foreign models lie to customs officials and work in the U S illegally and kept them in squalid conditions while they earned almost nothing for the work they did Trump s employment of foreign guest workers at his resorts which involves a claim that he can t find Americans to do the work Trump s use of hundreds of undocumented workers from Poland in the s who were paid a pittance for their illegal work Trump s history of being charged with housing discrimination Trump s connections to mafia figures involved in New York construction The time Trump paid the Federal Trade Commission over charges that he violated anti trust laws when trying to take over a rival casino company The fact that Trump is now being advised by Roger Ailes who was forced out as Fox News chief when dozens of women came forward to charge him with sexual harassment According to the allegations Ailes s behavior was positively monstrous as just one indicator his abusive and predatory actions toward women were so well known and so loathsome that in the morally upstanding folks in the Nixon administration refused to allow him to work there despite his key role in getting Nixon elected And that last one is happening right now To repeat the point is not that these stories have never been covered because they have The point is that they get covered briefly then everyone in the media moves on If any of these kinds of stories involved Clinton news organizations would rush to assign multiple reporters to them those reporters would start asking questions and we d learn more about all of them That s important because we may have reached a point where the frames around the candidates are locked in Trump is supposedly the crazy bigoted one and Clinton is supposedly the corrupt one Once we decide that those are the appropriate lenses through which the two candidates are to be viewed it shapes the decisions the media make every day about which stories are important to pursue And it means that to a great extent for all the controversy he has caused and all the unflattering stories in the press about him Trump is still being let off the hook ", "label": "pos"},

	{ "text": "An anonymous Jane Doe filed a federal lawsuit against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump last week accusing him of raping her in when she was thirteen years old The mainstream media ignored the filing If the Bill Cosby case has taught us anything it is to not disregard rape cases against famous men Serious journalists have publicly apologized for turning a blind eye to the Cosby accusers for over a decade notwithstanding the large number of women who had come forward with credible claims And now history is repeating itself In covering a story a media outlet is not finding guilt It is simply reporting the news that a lawsuit has been filed against Mr Trump and ideally putting the complaint in context Unproven allegations are just that unproven and should be identified that way Mr Trump s lawyer says the charges are categorically untrue completely fabricated and politically motivated Proof comes later at trial But the November election will come well before any trial And while Mr Trump is presumed innocent we are permitted no we are obligated to analyze the case s viability now No outsider can say whether Mr Trump is innocent or guilty of these new rape charges But we can look at his record analyze the court filings here and make a determination as to credibility whether the allegations are believable enough for us to take them seriously and investigate them keeping in mind his denial and reporting new facts as they develop I have done that And the answer is a clear yes These allegations are credible They ought not be ignored Mainstream media I m looking at you Consider the context Mr Trump s overt even proud misogyny The rape case must be viewed through the lens of Mr Trump s current longstanding and well documented contempt for women Men who objectify women are more likely to become perpetrators of sexual violence just as one with a long history of overtly racist comments is more likely to commit a hate crime Mr Trump has relished calling women dogs slobs and pigs and cyberstalked and derided journalist Megyn Kelly for having the temerity to ask him to defend his own words He threw out the most misogynist of attacks attempting to undermine her professionalism by accusing her of menstruating He s cruelly ridiculed the appearance of a female opponent Carly Fiorina and an opponent s wife Heidi Cruz His campaign even openly acknowledged that it disqualified all women for consideration as his vice president Mr Trump has a long history of debasing women he s worked with crossing the line on a regular basis He s taken lifelong joy in objectifying women including his proclamation Women you have to treat em like shit This cannot be ignored Decades of abusive language does not make him a rapist But it does show us who the man is a callous meanspirited misogynist who no sane person would leave alone with her daughter As Dr Maya Angelou said When someone shows you who they really are believe them More context two prior sexual assault court claims have been made against Mr Trump But Mr Trump has been accused of worse than just misogynist language Two prior women have accused Mr Trump in court documents of actual or attempted sexual assault Mr Trump denies all the allegations Under oath Ivana Trump accused Mr Trump of a violent rape First was Ivana Trump Donald Trump s first wife who said under oath in a deposition that he had violently attacked her ripped out her hair and forcibly penetrated her without her consent According to the Daily Beast she claims he was wildly angry that she d referred him to a cosmetic surgeon who had botched a scalp reduction job to cover a bald spot and caused pain in his scalp hence the vindictive yanking on her hair At the time Ms Trump said she felt violated by the alleged rape A few years later after their divorce was settled Ms Trump claimed that she did not mean the word rape in a literal or criminal sense Note virtually every settlement of a case involving a high profile person paying money to a former spouse or anyone requires the person receiving the money to agree in writing to ironclad nondisparagement and confidentiality In plain English you promise to be quiet and not say anything bad about the party paying you money This has been the case in hundreds of settlement agreements I have worked on over the years Ms Trump was almost certainly contractually prohibited after she signed from saying anything negative about Mr Trump And it is also common to attempt to cure prior negative statements with new agreed to language like I didn t mean it literally You didn t mean forcible penetration literally A business acquaintance accused Mr Trump of sexual harassment and attempted rape A second woman accused Donald Trump of sexual assault in According to The Guardian then year old Jill Harth alleged in a federal lawsuit that Trump violated her physical and mental integrity when he touched her intimately without consent after her husband went into business with him leaving her emotionally devastated and distraught The lawsuit called the multiple acts attempted rape Shortly thereafter she voluntarily withdrew the case when a parallel suit against Mr Trump brought by her husband was settled When The Guardian reached the woman in to ask whether she stood by her sexual assault allegations she responded yes In a court filing according to a report Ms Harth alleged that while she and her husband were trying to do a business deal with Mr Trump regarding a beauty pageant he repeatedly propositioned her for sex and groped her culminating in this frightening alleged incident Trump forcefully removed Harth from public areas of Mar A Lago in Florida and forced her into a bedroom belonging to defendant s daughter Ivanka wherein Trump forcibly kissed fondled and restrained her from leaving against her will and despite her protests In the court document she said that Trump bragged that he would be the best lover you ever have Recently Donald Trump issued a statement that women s claims of sexual harassment documented in a lengthy New York Times investigation which included Ms Harth s lawsuit were made up Jill Harth responded angrily on Twitter last week My part was true I didn t talk As usual you opened your big mouth In other words she is standing by her story The new Jane Doe child rape claim against Mr Trump is consistent with verifiable facts about Mr Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein and has a powerful witness statement attached to it A third woman accused Mr Trump of rape very recently According to the Daily Mail a woman filed an April lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein The woman claimed to have a witness Tiffany Doe to the incidents She filed the case in pro per that is without the assistance of a lawyer The case was dismissed by the court for technical filing errors She then obtained a lawyer and the case was modified and refiled in New York federal court against Mr Trump and Mr Epstein I ve carefully reviewed this federal complaint It is now much stronger than the one she filed on her own which makes sense because she now has an experienced litigator representing her Jane Doe says that as a year old she was enticed to attend parties at the home of Jeffrey Epstein with the promise of money modeling jobs Mr Epstein is a notorious billionaire pedophile who is now a Level registered sex offender the most dangerous kind a threat to public safety after being convicted of misconduct with another underage girl Jane Doe says that Mr Trump initiated sexual contact with her on four occasions in Since she was thirteen at the time consent is not an issue If Mr Trump had any type of sexual contact with her in it was a crime On the fourth incident she says Mr Trump tied her to a bed and forcibly raped her in a savage sexual attack while she pleaded with him to stop She says Mr Trump violently struck her in the face She says that afterward if she ever revealed what he had done Mr Trump threatened that she and her family would be physically harmed if not killed She says she has been in fear of him ever since New York s five year statute of limitations on this claim the legal deadline for filing has long since run However Jane Doe s attorney Thomas Meagher argues in his court filing that because she was threatened by Mr Trump she has been under duress all this time and therefore she should be permitted additional time to come forward Legally this is calling tolling stopping the clock allowing more time to file the case As a result the complaint alleges Jane Doe did not have freedom of will to institute suit earlier in time He cites two New York cases which I have read and which do support tolling Two unusual documents are attached to Jane Doe s complaints sworn declarations attesting to the facts The first is from Jane Doe herself telling her horrific story including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence and this stunner Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he Defendant Epstein should have been the one who took my virginity not Defendant Trump And this one Defendant Trump stated that I shouldn t ever say anything if I didn t want to disappear like Maria a year old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident and that he was capable of having my whole family killed The second declaration is even more astonishing because it is signed by Tiffany Doe Mr Epstein s party planner from Tiffany Doe says that her duties were to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties Adolescents are legally children Tiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York persuaded her to attend Mr Epstein s parties and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J Trump and Mr Epstein Both Mr Trump and Mr Epstein were advised that she was years old It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness But Tiffany Doe says I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr Trump during this period including the fourth of these encounters where Mr Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop Tiffany Doe corroborates based on her own personal observations just about everything in Jane Doe s complaint that year old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr Trump that Mr Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened and that she would disappear like Maria if she did Tiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr Trump to this day I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr Trump and Mr Epstein I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger Given all this and based on the record thus far Jane Doe s claims appear credible Mr Epstein s own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented as is Mr Trump s relationship with him two decades ago in New York City Mr Trump told a reporter a few years ago I ve known Jeff for years Terrific guy He s a lot of fun to be with It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do and many of them are on the younger side No doubt about it Jeffrey enjoys his social life Powerfully Jane Doe appears to have an eyewitness to all aspects of her claim a witness who appears to have put herself in substantial danger by coming forward because at a minimum Mr Epstein knows her true identity Jane Doe has not granted any interviews and we don t know anything about her background or Tiffany Doe s or the details of their stories Much information needs to be revealed to fully assess this case Perhaps they will be discredited on cross examination Perhaps they will recant But if we re going to speculate in that direction we should speculate in the other direction as well Perhaps Jane Doe and her lawyer will have more evidence and witnesses to corroborate her claim Perhaps witnesses from Mr Epstein s notorious parties will come forward We just can t know any of that at this point But based on what we do know now Jane Doe s claims fall squarely into the long ugly context of Mr Trump s life of misogyny are consistent with prior sexual misconduct claims are backed up by an eyewitness and thus should be taken seriously Her claims merit sober consideration and investigation We live in a world where wealthy powerful men often use and abuse women and girls While these allegations may shock some as a lawyer who represents women in sexual abuse cases every day I can tell you that sadly they are common as is an accuser s desire to remain anonymous and her terror in coming forward What do you call a nation that refuses to even look at sexual assault claims against a man seeking to lead the free world Rape culture We ignore the voices of women at our peril ", "label": "pos"},
